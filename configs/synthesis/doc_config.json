    "Require multi-hop reasoning (e.g., cross-reference + computation, footnote + chart reading)",
    "Use doc-search to find visuals, tables, footnotes with keywords like: Figure, Chart, Table, panel, footnote",
    "Use doc-read to extract detailed information from sections with specific goals",
    "Chain across pages: after finding a chart/table, search for its discussion elsewhere",
    "Collect content-based clues (captions, axis labels, legend items, headers) instead of explicit locations",
