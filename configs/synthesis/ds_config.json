    "Your data lives under the provided seed_path; start with ds_inspect_data.",
    "Prefer ds_run_python for any non-trivial computation (joins, aggregation, segmentation, clustering).",
    "When reading CSVs, use filenames like users.csv/products.csv/orders.csv (avoid embedding seed_path in csv_file).",
    "For user-level analysis, build features such as order_count, total_revenue, avg_order_value, category mix, recency.",

  "synthesis_tips": [
    "Generate ONLY complex data-analysis questions grounded in the provided CSV schema. Avoid metadata or filesystem-related queries.",
    "At least 1 question must involve multi-table joins (3+ tables) to calculate derived business metrics (e.g., User -> Orders -> Products).",
    "Include at least 1 question requiring Statistical Hypothesis Testing (e.g., T-Test, Chi-Squared, or ANOVA). Require the model to report P-values and determine significance at alpha=0.05.",
    "At least 2 questions must involve Machine Learning: one for Clustering (KMeans, n_clusters>=3) and one for Predictive Modeling (Linear/Logistic Regression).",
    "Include questions on Feature Correlation (Pearson/Spearman) and require interpretation of the coefficients (e.g., 'If correlation > 0.6, return...').",
    "Avoid questions based on data previews or 'head()' calls; all answers must be computed from the full, cleaned dataset.",
    "Ensure answers are formatted strictly as requested: numeric results (rounded to 2 decimal places), IDs, or key=value pairs."
