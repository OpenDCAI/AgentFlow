The frontend is distributed as the **LibTorch** zip (pre‑built headers, libraries, and CMake files).  \n\n- **Module definition in C++:** Modules inherit from `torch::nn::Module`. Parameters are registered with `register_parameter`, sub‑modules with `register_module`. The library uses a macro `TORCH_MODULE` that generates a holder class wrapping a `std::shared_ptr<Impl>` (e.g., `LinearImpl` → `Linear`).

It describes the Python API and notes that the backend is implemented in C++/CUDA.\n* Build configuration files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelignore`) show that **CMake** and **Bazel** are used to compile the C++/CUDA code.\n* Recent commit messages reference language‑specific changes (e.g., “Add uint16, uint32, uint64 support to JIT CUDA kernels” –\n\n2. The requested “about” page returns a 404 error, so it contains no information about the programming languages used in PyTorch’s implementation. No official documentation or source‑code details can be extracted from this URL.\n\n3. **Programming‑language details for PyTorch**\n\n- **Core implementation language:** PyTorch’s fundamental data structures (tensors, autograd, etc.) are written in **C++** (C++17). The Python API is a thin wrapper that sits on top of this C++ codebase.  \n\n- **C++ Frontend (LibTorch):** A pure C++17 interface that mirrors the Python `torch.nn` API. It provides modules, optimizers, data loaders, serialization, etc., all implemented in C++. The frontend is distributed as the **LibTorch** zip (pre‑built headers, libraries, and CMake files).  \n\n- **Module definition in C++:** Modules inherit from `torch::nn::Module`. Parameters are registered with `register_parameter`, sub‑modules with `register_module`. The library uses a macro `TORCH_MODULE` that generates a holder class wrapping a `std::shared_ptr<Impl>` (e.g., `LinearImpl` → `Linear`). This design gives reference‑semantics similar to Python while hiding explicit `shared_ptr` usage.  \n\n- **Source‑code locations:** Example implementation of a built‑in module is in the PyTorch repository at  \n  `torch/csrc/api/include/torch/nn/modules/linear.h` (see the `LinearImpl` definition). The macro `TORCH_MODULE` is defined in the same include hierarchy and creates the public `Linear` holder.  \n\n- **Official documentation:**  \n  - C++ API reference: **https://pytorch.org/cppdocs** (high‑level overview, API docs).  \n  - Frontend design overview: **https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/frontend.html**.  \n  - Namespace documentation for modules, optimizers, data API, etc., under `torch::nn`, `torch::optim`, `torch::data`.  \n\n- **Build system:** Uses **CMake** (CMake ≥ 3.5) to compile against LibTorch; the C++ code follows standard C++17 conventions and can be built on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  \n\n**Takeaway:** PyTorch is primarily a C++ (C++17) project; the Python front‑end is a wrapper over this C++ core. The official C++ documentation and the source files (e.g., `linear.h` in the GitHub repo) provide the authoritative information on the programming languages used.", "warning": null, "inputs": {"goal": "Find official documentation or source code information about the programming languages used in PyTorch's implementation.", "urls": ["https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch", "https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/about.html", "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.html"], "worker_id": "main_runner"}}, "success": true, "error": null, "execution_time_ms": 0.0}, {"tool_name": "web_search", "parameters": {"query": ["PyTorch core implemented in C++", "PyTorch C++ backend", "PyTorch language implementation"]}, "result": {"result": "A Google search for 'PyTorch core implemented in C++' found 10 results:\n\n## Web Results\n1.
