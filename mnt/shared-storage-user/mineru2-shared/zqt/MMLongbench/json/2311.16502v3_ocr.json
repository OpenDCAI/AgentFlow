These questions span 30 subjects and 183 subfields, comprising 30 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMMU focuses on advanced perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, challenging models to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts.

Candid and constructive discussions on AGI have been challenging due to a lack of shared operationalizable definitions. In an attempt to remedy this, Morris et al.

Since the definition is based on comparison with skilled adults, a natural starting point is college-level exams for different disciplines, because those are designed to evaluate skilled adults specialized in each discipline. This strategy has been successfully adopted in benchmarks such as MMLU [19] and AGIEval [69], but only text-based questions are considered, while human experts are capable of solving multimodal problems. Meanwhile, large multimodal models (LMMs) that can understand both text and images have been making a major stride towards more general AI [8, 14, 27, 34, 58]. These LMMs have consistently excelled in existing multimodal benchmarks [3, 18, 25, 31, 36, 50, 61, 63]. For instance, CogVLM [55] achieves \\(85\\%\\) on VQA-v2 [18], \\(92\\%\\) on ScienceQA-IMG [39], and \\(93\\%\\) on RefCOCO [23]. However, most existing multimodal benchmarks focus on commonsense/daily knowledge rather than expert-level domain knowledge and advanced reasoning. The closest one to our goal is ScienceQA [39]. While it covers diverse disciplines (breadth), the majority of the questions are at the elementary to the middle school level, thus falling short in depth for benchmarking Expert AGI."

MMMU consists of 11.5K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields, thus meeting the breadth goal. Moreover, many problems within MMMU require expert-level reasoning, such as applying \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth goal. MMMU also presents two unique challenges absent in current benchmarks (Figure 1). Firstly, it covers diverse image formats, from visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Secondly, MMMU features interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge, and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution."

Therefore, numerous all-round benchmarks have been established to assess different facets of LMMs. These benchmarks cover a wide spectrum of specific skills of LMMs, from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as seen in the study by [37], to adversarial robustness [68] and hallucination [13, 32], e.g., POPE [30] and HaELM [54]. More holistic evaluations have been conducted as well, such as LAMM [61], LVLM-eHub [57], SEED [25], MMBench [36], and MM-Vet [63]. These benchmarks still largely focus on relatively basic perception abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate reasoning. More recently, MathVista [40] presents a collection of visually challenging questions; however, its scope is limited exclusively to the mathematical domain. MMMU is highly different from these benchmarks by collecting more difficult expert-level problems that cover 30 different subjects and require nuanced perception, recalling domain-specific knowledge to perform step-by-step reasoning to derive the solution. In line with the motivation of our study, concurrently, GAIA [42] introduces 466 questions that test fundamental abilities of models such as reasoning, multimodality handling, or tool use."

This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model's adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge."

Consequently, we select 30 subjects from six different disciplines. In the second stage, we recruit over 50 university students, including co-authors, specializing in these majors as annotators to assist in question collection. They collect multimodal questions from major textbooks and online resources, creating new questions based on their expertise where necessary.

These suspected duplicates were then reviewed by the authors to identify and eliminate any duplications. The second stage involves distributing the problems among different co-authors for format and typo checking. This step requires authors to ensure adherence to a standardized format, undertaking necessary corrections where deviations are found. In the third and final stage, the authors categorize the problems into four difficulty levels: very easy, easy, medium, and hard. Approximately \\(10\\%\\) of the problems, classified as very easy and not aligning with our design criteria due to their simplistic nature, are excluded from the benchmark.

We adopt micro-averaged accuracy as the evaluation metric. For both open and multiple-choice questions, we design systematic, rule-based evaluation pipelines. Specifically, to mitigate the potential influence of any intermediate generations (e.g., reasoning steps, calculations) in the long response, we construct robust regular expressions and develop response-processing workflows. These are employed to extract key phrases, such as numbers and conclusion phrases, from the long responses for accurate answer matching. If there is no valid answer in the model's response, we perform random selection as a remedy for multiple-choice questions or consider the response incorrect for open questions.

As we analyze the root cause, we classify such errors as lack of knowledge (see analysis below). Additionally, GPT-4V often exhibits a bias towards text, prioritizing textual information over visual inputs, a trend noted in recent studies [13]. A prominent example is in Figure 68, where the model incorrectly prioritizes its text-based interpretation of “imperialism” over the visual narrative in a cartoon depicting the United States as a “Savior.” This underscores the need for a more balanced approach to"

MMMU not only tests the boundaries of what current LMMs can achieve in terms of basic perceptual skills but also evaluates their ability to handle complex reasoning and in-depth subject-specific knowledge. This approach directly contributes to our understanding of the progress towards Expert AGI, as it mirrors the kind of expertise and reasoning abilities expected of skilled adults in various professional fields."

And the focus on college-level subjects might not fully be a sufficient test for Expert AGI as per the definition [44]. However, we believe it should be necessary for an Expert AGI to achieve strong performance on MMMU to demonstrate their broad and deep subject knowledge as well as expert-level understanding and reasoning capabilities. In future work, we plan to incorporate human evaluations into MMMU. This will provide a more grounded comparison between model capabilities and expert performance, shedding light on the proximity of current AI systems to achieving Expert AGI."

Even without this use of color, the work would convey a theme of inequity because a little boy is pulling two adults, who seem to represent Western culture. The color contrast underscores the theme because one culture is depicted as bright, happy, and colorful, while the other is depicted as small and drab."

These arches create a visually striking pattern of rhythm and repetition, elevate the roofline by stacking arches, which compensates for the shorter columns, and contribute to the structure's stability. However, they are not related to the entrance of light and air, which is typically managed by windows, nor are they structurally supportive of a barrel-vaulted roof, as their design and construction cater to a flat roofing system. Hence, the correct answer is \"barrel-vaulted roofing,\" as it is the element not facilitated by the double-tiered columns."

Opportunity cost for Nation X: For 1 crepe, Nation X gives up producing 3 units of paper. So, opportunity cost of 1 crepe = 3 paper. For 1 paper, Nation X gives up producing 1/3 unit of crepe. So, opportunity cost of 1 paper = 1/3 crepe. Opportunity cost for Nation Y: For 1 crepe, Nation Y gives up producing 5 units of paper. So, opportunity cost of 1 crepe = 5 paper. For 1 paper, Nation Y gives up producing 1/5 unit of crepe. So, opportunity cost of 1 paper = 1/5 crepe. Comparing opportunity costs: Nation X has a lower opportunity cost \\((1/3 < 1/5)\\) in producing paper than Nation Y. So, Nation X has a comparative advantage in producing paper.

Given that point E offers a higher expected return while maintaining the same Sharpe ratio as point F, it should be considered more optimal than point F.

It appears that the firm was able to sell Product C at a much higher price than the target price of the product and lost money on Product B. Tom Watson, CEO, wants to promote Product C much more aggressively and phase out Product B. He believes that the information suggests that Product C has the greatest potential among the firm's three products because the actual selling price of Product C was almost \\(50\\%\\) higher than the target price, while the firm was forced to sell Product B at a price below the target price. Both the budgeted and actual factory overhead for the current year are \\(\\$ 510,000\\). The actual units sold for each product also are the same as the budgeted units. The firm uses direct labor dollars to assign manufacturing overhead costs. The direct materials and direct labor costs per unit for each product are: <image 2> The controller noticed that not all products consumed factory overhead similarly.

For the trait to be autosomal recessive: Both parents must be carriers to have an affected offspring. It should not skip generations unless both parents are carriers and just don't show the trait. From the pedigree, we see that: Individuals 3 and 12 are affected. This means both their parents (2 and 4 for individual 3, and 6 and 7 for individual 12) must be carriers. Individual 18's parents (15 and 17) are both unaffected. If individual 18 is a carrier, it means both 15 and 17 must also be carriers.

Given the information, if a wild type Arabidopsis were transformed with a chimeric gene consisting of an A class promoter fused to a B class coding sequence, then the B class gene would be expressed where normally only the A class gene would be active. Here's how the flower would develop according to the modified ABC model: Whorl 1 (outermost): Normally A class genes would specify sepals, but with the B class coding sequence under the A class promoter, it would be \\(\\mathrm{A + B}\\) which specifies petals."

The atom bonded to the chiral center with the highest atomic number gets the highest priority (1). If two atoms have the same atomic number, consider the atoms they are bonded to in order to determine priority. Orient the molecule so that the atom or group with the lowest priority (4) is pointing away (in the background). Observe the order of groups 1-2-3: If the order is clockwise, the configuration is R. If the order is counterclockwise, the configuration is S. Let's determine the configuration for the two chiral centers: For C-2: Attached groups and their atomic numbers: CH3 (Carbon = 6)Cl (Chlorine = 17)H (Hydrogen = 1)C2H5 (Carbon = 6, but this will have higher priority than CH3 because the subsequent carbons in the chain will be used for breaking the tie). Priority order: ClC2H5CH3H. With the H pointing to the background, the order is 1 (Cl) to 2 (C2H5) to 3 (CH3), which is clockwise. So, the configuration at C-2 is R. For C-3: Attached groups and their atomic numbers: H (Hydrogen = 1)Cl (Chlorine = 17)CH3 (Carbon = 6)C2H5 (Carbon = 6, but like before, C2H5 will have higher priority than CH3). Priority order: ClC2H5CH3H. With the H pointing to the background, the order is 1 (Cl) to 2 (C2H5) to 3 (CH3), which is counterclockwise. So, the configuration at C-3 is S. Therefore, the correct configuration for the compound is: 2R, 3S. So, the answer is (A) 2R, 3S."

Let's label our three colors as Red, Green, and Blue (for the sake of this explanation). We can begin by coloring face A with Red. Adjacent to A are B and C, so let's color B with Green and C with Blue. D is adjacent to both B and C, so it must be Red. E is adjacent to A, D, and B. Since A and D are Red and B is Green, E should be Blue. F is adjacent to C, D, and E. D is Red, E is Blue, so F should be Green. G is adjacent to D, F, and A. D is Red, F is Green, so G should be Blue. Lastly, H is adjacent to B, E, and F. B is Green, E is Blue, and F is Green. So H can be colored Red. From this coloring, it seems that we can color the diagram with three colors such that no two adjacent faces have the same color. Hence, the answer is:(A) Yes."

From the given information: \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{AOB} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{~m} \\angle \\mathrm{AB} = \\frac{1}{2} (104) = 52^\\circ \\), \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{COD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{~m} \\angle \\mathrm{CD} = \\frac{1}{2} (168) = 84^\\circ \\). Since chords AB and CD are parallel, \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{AOB} = \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{COD} \\), but we've just shown that \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{AOB} \\) is \\( 52^\\circ \\), which means that our diagram or understanding has an inconsistency because \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{COD} \\) is given as \\( 84^\\circ \\). However, assuming the information provided is correct and using the fact that the sum of measures of arcs intercepted by two inscribed angles that sum up to \\( 180^\\circ \\) will be \\( 360^\\circ \\), we get: \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{AB} + \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{BD} = 360^\\circ 104 + \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{BD} = 360^\\circ \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{BD} = 256^\\circ \\).

But, \\( \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{BOD} = 180^\\circ - \\mathrm{m} \\angle \\mathrm{COD} = 180^\\circ - 84^\\circ = 96^\\circ \\), which contradicts our previous calculation.

In this question, it incorrectly interprets \\( \\mathrm{m} \\rightharpoonup \\mathrm{AB} = 104 \\) as the measure of an inscribed angle, when the correct interpretation should be the measure of an arc or a central angle. Therefore, the angle represented in the question, \\( \\angle AOB \\), is 104 degrees, and \\( \\angle COD \\) is 168 degrees. Since the concept is confused right from the start, GPT4-V does not derive the correct answer in the subsequent calculations. The key to the question is to determine the angle of BOD, which is equal to the angle AOC by using the condition of parallel lines. Then, by subtracting the two given angles from 360 degrees and dividing by two, we can obtain the correct answer."

The speed of coin A is: \\( vA = \\omega r \\). The speed of coin B is: \\( vB = \\omega (2r) = 2\\omega r \\). Comparing the two speeds: \\( vB = 2vA \\). Thus, the speed of A is half that of B.

Post-mature newborns are at an increased risk of passing meconium (the baby's first stool) into the amniotic fluid before birth or during labor. If the baby breathes the meconium-stained amniotic fluid into their lungs, it can cause a blockage of the airways, leading to meconium aspiration syndrome. The chest X-ray of a newborn with meconium aspiration syndrome might show patchy or streaky areas on the lungs. However, it's important to consult with a pediatric radiologist or neonatologist for a definitive diagnosis based on clinical findings and the entire clinical picture."

It can drive the process to dysplasia and to carcinoma. HPV by itself does not produce significant inflammation. B. The capsaicin in chili tends to irritate nerve endings to produce the hot burning sensation, as a local effect in oral cavity. It is not systemic. Capsaicin has been used to treat dyspareunia with vulvar vestibulitis, probably by affecting nerve-ending mediated sensation, and there is no significant degree of inflammation. C. Diabetes mellitus may increase the risk for infections, but by itself does not explain the inflammation seen here. D. Tuberculosis of the genital tract is rare; mycobacterial infections tend to produce granulomatous inflammation. E. This is a chronic inflammatory process, based upon the inflammatory cell population of mononuclear cells, mainly small round lymphocytes. There is also some hemorrhage. The squamous epithelium is normal, though if this were endocervix, it would represent squamous metaplasia."

The pressure readings are also indicative. The normal pressure in the left atrium is usually around \\(10 \\mathrm{~mmHg}\\), while the pressure in the left ventricle during systole (contraction) can go up to \\(120 \\mathrm{~mmHg}\\) or more and during diastole (relaxation) drops significantly. The given pressure for the left ventricle is \\(165 / 45 \\mathrm{~mmHg}\\), which is significantly high during systole. Meanwhile, the pressure in the ascending aorta is \\(155 / 70 \\mathrm{~mmHg}\\), which is closer to normal systolic pressure but has an elevated diastolic pressure. These findings indicate that blood is flowing back from the left ventricle to the left atrium during ventricular systole, which is consistent with mitral regurgitation. During mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This can cause symptoms like palpitations and can be associated with a heart murmur on physical examination. Thus, the most likely diagnosis based on the provided data is: (B) Mitral regurgitation."

This backflow decreases diastolic pressure in the aorta (N = 60-90 mm Hg) and increases diastolic pressure in the left ventricle (N = 5-12 mm Hg). This regurgitant blood combines with blood from the left atrium to fill the left ventricle, which results in an increased preload and a subsequent increase in stroke volume. As a result, the systolic pressure in both the ascending aorta (N = 90-140 mm Hg) and in the left ventricle (N = 90-140 mm Hg) is increased. Oxygen saturation and right heart pressures are normal in aortic regurgitation."

This confusion may have stemmed from two main factors: First, the model's attention may have been solely on the highlighted portion, whose pointed shape is characteristic of the QRS complex. Second, the model may have evaluated the entire electrocardiogram but misidentified the P wave due to its typically more rounded shape. A proper assessment of the whole electrocardiogram reveals that the QRS complex is actually represented by the taller spikes that come after the highlighted section, indicating that the highlighted area is, indeed, the P wave."

However, the synthesis is most efficient for creating analogues with a variety of heterocyclic rings. That is because the reaction sequence could be carried out on large scale to produce a supply of the penultimate structure. Analogues could then be created in one step by reacting this structure with different heterocyclic acid chlorides. If the synthetic scheme was used to create analogues at the other positions indicated, then more reactions will be needed. For example, varying the type of alkyl substituent present at position B would involve carrying out the complete synthesis for each analogue."

In the presence of an MAOI, Norepinephrine would still exert its direct effect, but Tyramine, which typically induces the release of stored catecholamines, would result in an amplified effect due to the blocked degradation of norepinephrine. The lack of a hypertensive response to Tyramine in the second trace suggests that its conversion to norepinephrine might have been blocked, consistent with the action of an MAOI. Thus, the correct answer is: (B) phenelzine."

At the Munich Conference of 1938, which included Hitler, Mussolini, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of England, Hitler was given the Sudetenland, without the consent of Czechoslovakia, in return for the promise to cease his expansionist activities. The cartoon shows Hitler placing Austria in his bag, which would set this cartoon right at the time of the Munich Conference. Choice (D) is correct. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a World War I era treaty that set the stage for Russia's exit from the war. Eliminate (A). The Tripartite Pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan did not occur until two years after this cartoon was created. Eliminate (B). The Anti-Comintern Pact signed between Germany, Italy, and Japan focused on a mutual defense against Russia and had nothing to do with Austria. Eliminate (C)."

Although one might be tempted to cast the United States in the role of imperialist (B), the purpose of the cartoon is to highlight the positive transformation of the people due to their \"rescue\" by the United States, rather than the benefits to the United States. Because the cartoon claims the people are better off for having been \"rescued\" by the United States, the United States is not seen as an oppressor (A). Since isolationists do not support foreign intervention, (D) cannot be the correct answer."

Given the choices provided and the context of Symbolic Interactionism, the most appropriate answer is: (B) Master status. Master status refers to a social position that is the primary identifying characteristic of an individual. It dominates other statuses and thereby determines a person's general position in society. In the context of crime, some symbolic interactionists might argue that an individual's master status (e.g., being labeled as a \"criminal\") could influence their interactions and how they are perceived by others in society."

Essentially, an individual who grows up in a poor neighbourhood with high rates of drug use, violence, teenage delinquency, and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighbourhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community. Therefore, the primary/core reason is wealth. The answer is D."

Studies from both comparative and human psychology have supported Skinner's initial findings and expanded upon them. The following figure shows a hypothetical example of various operant conditioning trials. During these trials, when a rat pressed a bar (as indicated by the hash mark on the graph), the behavior was reinforced by the presentation of a food pellet. The reinforcement schedule differs in each cell of the figure. Time is displayed on the x-axis and cumulative responses (bar presses) is displayed on the y-axis. ([image 1]) Imagine that you are watching a rat complete one of the tasks in the figure above. The rat is pressing the bar at a very high rate and takes a short break from pressing the bar each time the food pellet is delivered. What type of reinforcement schedule are you MOST likely watching?"

Here, reinforcement is given after a set number of responses, which is reflected in the steep inclines followed by drops on the graph. The rat's behavior—rapid pressing until receiving a pellet, then pausing—matches this schedule, indicating it understands that a specific number of presses leads to a reward, thus causing the observed high response rate followed by a break."

The mechanism of action for this non-pharmacologic intervention is not entirely known, but scientists believe that the act of focusing one's thoughts and deep belly-breathing both serve to somehow inhibit the stress response activated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that causes a range of abdominal discomfort and bowel irregularities, but unlike bowel diseases with similar symptoms, there are no physical abnormalities; rather, the disorder appears to be the physical manifestation of psychological triggers. The current standard non-pharmacologic treatment for IBS is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT treats IBS sufferers by treating the emotional and psychological triggers that cause physical symptoms. In an attempt to determine if meditation is as beneficial as CBT for treating IBS, a recent six-month study was conducted on female IBS sufferers. Eligible participants had active IBS symptoms for at least three months during the past year. Participants with and without a diagnosed anxiety disorder were recruited to participate in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a CBT group, a guided-meditation group, and a no-treatment group. Approximately \\(65\\%\\) of the participants had an anxiety disorder, and these subjects were roughly equally represented in each of the three groups. The results of this study, measured by percent reduction of IBS symptoms after treatment, are summarized in Figure 1. <image 1> Based on the results of this study, what can be most reasonably concluded about the efficacy of CBT for IBS sufferers who do not have an anxiety disorder?"

In a typical situation, when ethylene binds to its receptor (ETR1, ERS1, ERS2), it prevents the receptor from activating CTR1, which in turn allows the downstream signaling pathway to proceed, leading to the activation of EIN2, EIN3, and the ethylene response (seedling triple response). In the case of the ein4 mutant, which cannot bind ethylene, the pathway from the ethylene receptor to the downstream components would not be initiated. Since EIN4 is presumably an ethylene receptor like ETR1 and the mutant form of EIN4 cannot bind ethylene, this means that the receptor cannot turn off the CTR1, leading to the inhibition of the seedling triple response due to the constitutive activation of CTR1. Therefore, the correct answer is:(D) CTR1 will be activated and inhibit the seedling triple response. This is because in the ein4 mutant, ethylene cannot bind to EIN4 to inhibit CTR1, thus CTR1 remains active and the signaling pathway is off, preventing the seedling triple response."

The text mentioned \"a brown pit\" and conditions \"favored by drought\", which led the model to incorrectly infer the disease as charcoal rot. However, based on the visual symptoms displayed in the image, the disease aligns more closely with brown stem rot. This type of error highlights a shortfall in the model's capability to use visual signals to identify and differentiate between similar plant diseases."

The formula to calculate elongation or contraction in an axially loaded member is: \\(\\delta = \\frac{\\mathrm{PL}}{\\mathrm{AE}}\\), where \\(\\mathrm{P}\\) is the axial force in the member, \\(\\mathrm{L}\\) is the length of the member, A is the cross-sectional area of the member, and E is the modulus of elasticity. Given: \\(\\mathrm{A} = 2400\\mathrm{mm}^2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E} = 200\\mathrm{Gpa} = 200\\times 10^{3}\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^{2}}\\). First, let's find the forces in the members by applying the method of joints at joint A and joint D. At Joint A: There are two non-collinear unknown member forces, making it a solvable joint. Let's solve for AB and AF. \\(\\sum F_y = 0\\), \\(F_{AB}\\cos (45^\\circ) - F_{AF} = 0\\). \\(\\sum F_x = 0\\), \\(F_{AB}\\sin (45^\\circ) = 0\\). \\(F_{AB} = 0\\) and \\(F_{AF} = 0\\).

(1) \\(F_{DE} = 240 - F_{DC}\\cos (45^\\circ)\\). \\(\\sum F_x = 0\\), \\(F_{DC}\\sin (45^\\circ) = 0\\). \\(F_{DC} = 0\\). From (1), \\(F_{DE} = 240\\mathrm{kN}\\). Compute the elongation in the members: For DE (in tension, elongation): \\(\\delta_{DE} = \\frac{P_{DE}\\times L_{DE}}{A\\times E} = \\frac{240\\times 10^3\\times 8000}{2400\\times 200\\times 10^3} = 8mm\\). Considering the geometry of the truss, the horizontal component of the elongation at DE is: \\(\\delta_B = \\delta_{DE}\\cos (45^\\circ)\\approx 5.657mm\\). Thus, the answer is: (D) 5.657 mm."

The Greenshields model relates speed (u) and density (k) using the equation: \\( u = u_{max} - u_{max} / k_{jam} \\times k \\), where \\( u_{max} \\) is the maximum speed (which occurs when density \\( k \\) is zero) and \\( k_{jam} \\) is the jam density. From this equation, we can derive a linear relationship: \\( u = u_{max} - u_{max} / k_{jam} \\times k \\). If we rearrange the terms, it looks like: \\( u = -u_{max} / k_{jam} \\times k + u_{max} \\). Here, the term \\( -u_{max} / k_{jam} \\) is the slope of the line, and \\( u_{max} \\) is the y-intercept. We'll now use the data provided to determine the slope and y-intercept using regression analysis, from which we can then derive \\( k_{jam} \\). Let's compute the regression parameters: Given data points: Speed (u): 14.2, 24.1, 30.3, 40.1, 50.6, 55.0; Density (k): 85, 70, 55, 41, 20, 15. Using regression analysis on this data, the equation of the line relating speed and density would be: \\( u = mk + c \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( c \\) is the y-intercept. By comparing this to the Greenshields model equation, we can deduce: \\( u = -u_{max} / k_{jam}, c = u_{max} \\). From the given data: \\( u_{max} = 55.0 \\) (from the highest speed value). Using the above equation for \\( m \\): \\( k_{jam} = -u_{max} / u \\). Once we determine the slope \\( m \\) using the regression analysis, we can solve for \\( k_{jam} \\). For the purpose of this exercise, I will not be calculating the slope using the regression formula directly (as that would be computationally intensive), but based on the linear relationship implied by the data, the jam density \\( k_{jam} \\) would be slightly greater than the highest density value provided (85 veh/km). Using this logic, the closest option from the choices given is: \\( kj = 110 \\), veh/mi. Therefore, the answer would be: (A) \\( kj = 110 \\) veh/mi."

However, without more details regarding the acceptance criteria for each state (like which states are accepting and which are not), we can't definitively determine minimality from the diagram alone. But, let's try to infer some information from the given diagram: There's no unreachable state from the start state; every state can be reached. There's no state with identical transitions for the given inputs which could suggest merging. However, one thing to note is that two states are equivalent (and can be merged) if they have the same transitions on every input to the same set of states, and they are either both accepting or both non-accepting. Without knowing which states are accepting, we can't definitively say if the DFA is minimal or not. Therefore, the answer is: (C) not sure."

Equivalent states are states from which for every input string, the automaton ends in either an accepting state or a non-accepting state for both states in question. The given DFA has 5 states labeled 0 through 4. To check for equivalent states: We start by marking pairs of states where one is an accepting state and the other is not. In this DFA, however, there's no indication of which states are accepting and which are not, so we'll assume all states are relevant for now. Next, for each pair of states \\((i,j)\\), we check if for any input (a or b), the transitions \\(\\delta(i,a)\\) and \\(\\delta(j,a)\\), and \\(\\delta(i,b)\\) and \\(\\delta(j,b)\\) lead to the same state or already marked pair of states. If not, we mark the pair \\((i,j)\\). In the given DFA:"

Using the data points \\((T, \\mu) = (200\\mathrm{K}, 1.50\\mathrm{E} - 5)\\) and \\((400\\mathrm{K}, 2.43\\mathrm{E} - 5)\\): For the first point: \\(\\ln (1.50\\mathrm{E} - 5) = \\ln (\\mathrm{C}) + k\\backslash \\ln (200)\\) (1). For the second point: \\(\\ln (2.43\\mathrm{E} - 5) = \\ln (\\mathrm{C}) + k\\ln (400)\\) (2)."

From the given image, we can infer that the process is polytropic and is described by the equation: \\(PV^n =\\) constant. For a polytropic process involving an ideal gas: \\(W_{12} = (P_2V_2 - P_1V_1) / (1 - n)\\). Given: \\(P_1 = 100\\mathrm{kPa}\\), \\(V_{1} = 0.2m^{3}\\), \\(T_{1} = 10^{\\circ}C\\), \\(P_{2} = 700\\mathrm{kPa}\\), \\(T_{2} = 290^{\\circ}C\\). To find \\(V_{2}\\), we use the polytropic relationship: \\(P_{1}V_{1}^{n} / P_{2} = V_{2}^{n}\\). The value of \\(n\\) can be determined using the temperatures and the ideal gas law: \\(P_{1}V_{1} / T_{1} = P_{2}V_{2} / T_{2}\\). Once \\(V_{2}\\) is known, the work \\(W_{12}\\) can be determined using the equation for polytropic work. The change in internal energy \\(\\Delta U\\) for an ideal gas like helium is only a function of temperature and can be determined using: \\(\\Delta U = mC_v(T_2 - T_1)\\), where \\(C_v =\\) Specific heat at constant volume for helium (approximately \\(3.12\\mathrm{kJ/kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}\\)), and \\(m =\\) Mass of the helium. Mass can be determined using the ideal gas law: \\(m = P_1V_1 / RT_1\\), where \\(R\\) is the specific gas constant for helium, approximately \\(2.0831\\mathrm{kJ/kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}\\). Finally, using the first law of thermodynamics: \\(Q_{12} = \\Delta U + W_{12} =\\). The given options for \\(Q_{12}\\) are in kJ, so we need to ensure that all values used in calculations are consistent with this unit. To determine \\(Q_{12}\\), we will: Calculate the mass m of helium, determine \\(V_{2}\\) using the polytropic relationship, calculate the work \\(W_{12}\\), determine the change in internal energy \\(\\Delta U\\), and use the first law to calculate \\(Q_{12}\\). Now, let's plug in the values and solve: Calculate mass: \\(m = P_1V_1 / RT_1 = 100kPa * 0.2m^3 / (2.0831kJ/kg \\cdot K * (10 + 273)) \\approx 0.0271kg\\). Determine \\(V_{2}\\) using the given temperatures and the ideal gas relationship (this is iterative and requires more involved math). Calculate the work \\(W_{12}\\) using the polytropic equation. Determine the change in internal energy: \\(\\Delta U = mC_v(T_2 - T_1) \\approx 23.75kJ\\). Use the first law: \\(Q_{12} = \\Delta U + W_{12}\\). Now, without the exact value for \\(W_{12}\\) (which requires the iterative determination of V_2 and n), it's hard to provide an exact answer. However, considering the given options, you can solve for \\(Q_{12}\\) using the above steps. If you have the value for n or more specific data, please provide it, and I can assist further."

For Corner A: Since the rectangle is deformed into a parallelogram, the top left corner D is displaced by \\(5\\mathrm{mm}\\) to the right. Thus, the shear strain at point A due to this horizontal displacement is: \\(\\gamma_{xy}A = \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\\). Given: \\(\\delta y = 0\\) (There's no vertical displacement at A), \\(\\delta x = 5\\mathrm{mm}, \\gamma_{xy}A = \\frac{0}{300\\mathrm{mm}} = 0\\) rad. For Corner B: The bottom right corner C is displaced by \\(5\\mathrm{mm}\\) upwards. Thus, the shear strain at point B due to this vertical displacement is: \\(\\gamma_{xy}B = \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\\). Given: \\(\\delta y = 5\\mathrm{mm}, \\delta x = 400\\mathrm{mm}\\), \\(\\gamma_{xy}B = \\frac{5\\mathrm{mm}}{400\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.0125\\) rad. Therefore, the average shear strain at corners A and B are: A: 0 rad, B: 0.0125 rad. But, since the question has provided choices with minimum values of 0.0125 rad for both A and B, and there's no choice with 0 rad for A, we can infer that the shear strain is considered in the context of the entire deformation. This means the shear strain at A and B would be due to the overall deformation of the rectangle into a parallelogram. Given that both A and D move to the right by \\(5\\mathrm{mm}\\) and both B and C move up by \\(5\\mathrm{mm}\\), the average shear strain for the entire deformation at both points would be: \\(\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{5\\mathrm{mm}}{400\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.0125\\) rad (for both A and B). So, the correct answer is: (D) 0.0125 rad, 0.0125 rad."

The final value theorem states that: \\( \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}e(t) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}sE(s) \\), where \\( E(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the error signal \\( e(t) \\). Given a system with unity feedback, the error signal in the Laplace domain can be given by: \\( E(s) = R(s) - C(s) \\), where \\( R(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the reference input, and \\( C(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the system's output. The closed-loop transfer function for a unity feedback system is given by: \\( T(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s)) \\). Given a step input \\( r(t) = 25u(t) \\), the Laplace transform is: \\( R(s) = 25 / s \\).

Now, evaluate this limit to find the steady-state error. After evaluating, the answer will be one of the given options. Let's compute the steady-state error: \\( e_{ss} = 25\\times lim_{s\\to 0}[1 - G(s) / (1 + G(s))] \\). Solve for \\( e_{ss} \\): Using the given \\( G(s) \\) in the expression and computing the limit, you'll find that: \\( e_{ss} = 25\\times (1 - 1) = 0 \\). So, the steady-state error for the test input \\( 25u(t) \\) is: \\( e_{ss} = 0 \\). Thus, the correct answer is: (A) 0."

Part 1: The potential energy lost by the spheres will be equal to their change in kinetic energy. Potential energy lost by each sphere \\( = mgh \\). For sphere 1: Height \\( h_1 = R \\). For sphere 2: Height \\( h_2 = 2R \\) Total potential energy lost: \\( PE_{total} = mgh_1 + mgh_2 = mgR + 2mgR = 3mgR \\).

Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall a vertical distance of \\((26\\mathrm{m} - 16\\mathrm{m}) = 10\\mathrm{m}\\) after clearing the obstruction at B. Using the equation: \\(s = \\frac{1}{2} gt^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the vertical displacement \\(= 10\\mathrm{m}\\), \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity \\(= 9.81\\mathrm{m/s}\\), and the falling time \\(\\approx 1.428\\mathrm{s}\\). Step 2: Determine the horizontal distance covered in this time. This is the distance from A to the point right before the obstruction at B. Given that the total horizontal distance is \\(40\\mathrm{m}\\), the distance from A to just before B is \\(40\\mathrm{m}\\). Step 3: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall \\(26\\mathrm{m}\\) from A. Using the equation: \\(s = \\frac{1}{2} gt^2\\), where \\(s = 26\\mathrm{m}\\), we obtain \\(t \\approx 2.302\\mathrm{s}\\). Step 4: Using time from Step 3, determine the horizontal distance the rock covers from A \\(= 40\\mathrm{m}\\). Step 5: Equating the expressions for \\(u\\) from Step 2 and Step 4, Solving for width we get: width \\(\\approx 17.469\\mathrm{m}\\). Plugging this into the equation from Step 2: \\(u \\approx 15.775\\mathrm{m/s}\\). But we made a mistake. When the rock just clears the obstruction, it doesn't have a vertical velocity of 0. In fact, its vertical velocity \\(v\\) when it clears the obstruction at B is given by: \\(v^2 = u^2 - 2gsv^2 = u^2 - 2gs\\), where \\(s = 10\\mathrm{m}\\). Plugging in \\(u \\approx 15.775\\mathrm{m/s}\\) to obtain \\(v \\approx 24.014\\mathrm{m/s}\\)."
