This paper introduces a novel framework, LOGIC-LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical problem-solving. Our method first utilizes LLMs to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic formulation. Afterward, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem. We also introduce a self-refinement module, which utilizes the symbolic solver's error messages to revise symbolic formalizations. We demonstrate LOGIC-LM's effectiveness on five logical reasoning datasets: ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, FOLIO, LogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT. On average, LOGIC-LM achieves a significant performance boost of \\(39.2\\%\\) over using LLM alone with standard prompting and \\(18.4\\%\\) over LLM with chain-of-thought prompting. Our findings suggest that LOGIC-LM, by combining LLMs with symbolic logic, offers a promising avenue for faithful logical reasoning.\\(^{1}\\)"

It plays a central role in intelligent systems for problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022a; OpenAI, 2023) have exhibited emergent ability to \"reason\" like human (Wei et al., 2022a). When prompted with step-wise explanations of reasoning (\"chain of thoughts\"), or a simple prompt \"Let's think step by step.\", these models are able to answer questions with explicit reasoning steps (Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022)."

Recent studies (Golovneva et al., 2023; Ribeiro et al., 2023b; Lyu et al., 2023) found that LLMs occasionally make unfaithful reasoning, i.e., the derived conclusion does not follow the previously generated reasoning chain. While chain-of-thought may imitate human reasoning processes, the fundamental nature of LLMs remains that of black-box probabilistic models, lacking a mechanism to guarantee the faithfulness of reasoning (Shanahan, 2022). In contrast, symbolic inference engines, such as expert systems (Metaxiotis et al., 2002), are faithful and transparent because the reasoning is based on symbolic-represented knowledge and follows well-defined inference rules that adhere to logical principles. The main obstacle is how to accurately translate a problem into symbolic representations, considering the inherent ambiguity and flexibility of natural language. This is precisely where LLMs excel, making LLMs a promising complement to symbolic solvers."

During problem formulation, an LLM converts the natural language description of the problem into an appropriate symbolic formulation, identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement. Subsequently, at the symbolic reasoning stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation. Lastly, a result interpreter explains the output and maps it to the correct answer. By incorporating LLMs with symbolic solvers, we can exploit the robust natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to precisely represent the problem using symbolic representations, while also taking advantage of the logical faithfulness and transparency offered by symbolic solvers. To improve the accuracy of the symbolic parsing, we also incorporate the idea of self-refinement to iteratively revise the generated logical form using the error messages from the symbolic solver as feedback."

Typical methods include chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023) that generates explanations before the final answer and the least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2023) that breaks the problem down into simpler components that can be solved individually. Both the above approaches perform reasoning directly over natural language (NL), providing greater flexibility than symbolic-based reasoning. However, the intrinsic complexity and ambiguity of NL also bring undesired issues such as unfaithful reasoning and hallucinations."

Recent works (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022) have achieved improved performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks by generating Python programs that specify the reasoning procedure as chained commands in the order of execution. However, this idea has not been extended to logical reasoning problems, primarily due to the challenge of representing their highly \"non-linear\" reasoning procedure (e.g., hypothesizing, case-by-case analysis, and the process of elimination) with functional programming. Our work provides a novel way to solve this within the framework of augmented LLMs. Instead of parsing the problem-solving procedure as programs, we only describe the problem with symbolic language using LLMs and then offload the reasoning to external symbolic solvers."

Mathematical reasoning can be considered a specialized subset of logical reasoning, primarily focused on numeric deductions. Due to this numeric specificity, mathematical problems are often more readily translatable to symbolic forms. In contrast, logical reasoning covers a wider array of problem types, often requiring a deeper understanding of world knowledge and commonsense for effective parsing into symbolic forms. Despite plenty of works studying mathematical reasoning, our work pioneers in extending the concept of autoformalization to a broader range of logical reasoning tasks with modern LLMs."

Here we extend this idea to refine generated logic representations. If the symbolic solver returns an execution error, we instruct the LLM to refine the incorrect logical form, by prompting it with the erroneous logic form, the solver's error message, and a set of demonstrations showing common error cases (e.g., a free variable is not bounded to any quantifier in FOL) and their remedies. We run this process iteratively until either no error messages are returned, or the maximum number of allowable revisions is reached."

However, FOL and CSP problems often necessitate more sophisticated reasoning strategies that are \"nonlinear\" compared to standard forward-chain reasoning. These include hypothesizing, conditioning, recursive inference, and the process of elimination. Compared to CoT, the integration of symbolic solvers is better suited to these reasoning styles, hence yielding a more marked improvement on FOLO ( \\(+21.85\\%\\) ), LogicalDeduction \\((+45.67\\%)\\), and AR-LSAT \\((+24.14\\%)\\)."

Ideally, the complexity of formally representing a problem statement in logical form should remain relatively constant, regardless of whether the questions require simple or complex reasoning. The trends in Figure 3 validate this assumption. The performance of Standard and CoT declines precipitously with the escalation of problem complexity. However, this trend is less prominent for LOGIC-LM, indicating that the robust reasoning capabilities provided by external solvers substantially mitigate performance degradation for complex reasoning problems."

Additionally, our method can be extended to reasoning problems requiring commonsense, which remains a significant challenge as they often require reasoning over complex and ambiguous rules."

As a consequence, the model's applicability is inherently bounded by the expressiveness of the symbolic solver, for example, not all problems can be easily encoded in first-order logic. Nevertheless, this limitation can be mitigated by integrating a more diverse set of symbolic solvers. The flexible design of LOGIC-LM facilitates this integration. The wide range of reasoning tasks that we can instantiate our LOGIC-LM framework on shows its general applicability."

While this method has proven to be effective, it may face difficulties when dealing with logical representations with intricate grammar structures, such as probabilistic soft logic. This arises from the difficulty in conveying complex grammatical rules to the language model through a limited number of demonstrations within a constrained context size. As a potential solution, future works could explore the development of specialized modules to enhance the mapping between NL and symbolic language, e.g., fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data generated via symbolic solvers."

By comparing with the goal statement ConductElectricity(Nail, False), we can know that goal to be proved is False. For FOLIO, the FOL inference engine directly returns the veracity label of the goal as ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, and CONTINGENT, which can be mapped to True, False, and Unknown, respectively. For LogicalDeduction, the solver returns all the possible value assignments in an array. We write rules to parse each option into the corresponding value and check it is in the generated array.
