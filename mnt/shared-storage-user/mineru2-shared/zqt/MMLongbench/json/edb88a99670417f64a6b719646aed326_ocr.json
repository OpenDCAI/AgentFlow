Now when we went down to the Clark County Detention Center to post bond for Ms. Redacted by they told me another bail company had already posted bond for the same person. When I got back to the office, I called the Mr. Redacted by to ask if they have gone somewhere else for the bond or if maybe one of her friends or relatives did. They replied \"NO\" that we where the only ones that they have spoke with and did not want any other bail company to post bond for Ms. Redacted by Well when Ms. Redacted by was released from jail she came straight to our office and asked why did Redacted by bail her out? That she did not know who they were or give them authorization to post her bond. Ms. Redacted by is very upset because now someone from Redacted by keeps calling her and demanding for $500 for the bond, if not they said they would take her back to jail. I contacted Redacted by today and they told me that they had \"No one go into there office to co-sign or pay any money for the bond\". \"That she contacted them from inside the jail and self bonded her self out, all because she is a home owner\". I did not think that was fair to Redacted by"
