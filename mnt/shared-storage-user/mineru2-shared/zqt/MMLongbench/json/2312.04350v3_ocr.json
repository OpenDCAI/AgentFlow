In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can coherently reason about causality. Much of the existing work in natural language processing (NLP) focuses on evaluating commonsense causal reasoning in LLMs, thus failing to assess whether a model can perform causal inference in accordance with a set of well-defined formal rules. To address this, we propose a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, inspired by the \"causal inference engine\" postulated by Judea Pearl et al. We compose a large dataset, CLADDER, with 10K samples: based on a collection of causal graphs and queries (associational, interventional, and counterfactual), we obtain symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, through an oracle causal inference engine. These are then translated into natural language. We evaluate multiple LLMs on our dataset, and we introduce and evaluate a bespoke chain-of-thought prompting strategy, CAUSALCOt. We show that our task is highly challenging for LLMs, and we conduct an in-depth analysis to gain deeper insights into the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs.<sup>1</sup>"

This involves assessing the alignment between commonsense knowledge about causal relationships in humans and LLMs. This line of work generally does not focus on evaluating how well models are capable of causal reasoning. For example, it may be difficult to rule out the possibility that LLMs perform potentially unreliable amortized causal inference, answering causal questions by a simple repetition of verbal patterns present in the texts composing their training data:[2,3] in other words, LLMs may just be \"causal parrots\" [100]."

The specificity of CLADDER is that causal questions posed in natural language are grounded in symbolic questions and ground truth answers: the latter are derived through an oracle causal inference engine (CI engine) [66], which abides by the rules of the causal inference approach described by Pearl [61], based on graphical models and structural causal models (SCMs) [23, 59, 61, 69, 88]. We compose more than 10,000 causal questions that cover a variety of causal queries across the three rungs of the Ladder of Causation [3, 66]—i.e., associational (Rung 1), interventional (Rung 2), and counterfactual (Rung 3). We consider several causal graphs, giving rise to scenarios which require different causal inference abilities. Additionally, we generate ground-truth explanations with step-by-step reasoning for more in-depth analysis of LLM behavior. Our symbolic questions and answers are then verbalized, by turning them into stories which can be expressed in natural language. To probe whether LLMs employ amortized causal inference, we construct stories with commonsensical, as well as anti-commonsensical and with nonsensical causal relations: in these latter cases, amortized causal inference is expected to fail, whereas formal causal reasoning would still yield the correct answer. An example question from CLADDER is shown in Figure 1."

A crucial question is then under what conditions are such inferences possible, i.e., what assumptions and measurements are required to unambiguously answer a causal query of interest: this is the question of identification. As argued in [3], \"it is generically impossible to draw higher-layer inferences using only lower-layer information\". One may be able to draw inferences at a higher layer given a combination of partial knowledge of the underlying SCM, in the form of a causal graph, and data at lower layers. The graphical structure therefore plays a crucial role in bridging the rungs of the Ladder of Causation, and many prior works have been dedicated to exploiting properties of the graph to transform higher-rung queries into expressions which can be estimated based on lower-rung quantities [36, 64, 84]."

Moreover, since LLMs struggle with calculation-heavy tasks [32, 91], and we are chiefly interested in causal reasoning abilities, we focus on graphs with few (three to four) variables, in various common configurations, to produce questions which are identifiable from the outset. Lastly, we carefully design a rich set of templates to translate the abstract formulas into grammatically correct and natural-sounding, fluent prompts."

However, it is very likely that at least some of the stories appear in the training data of many LLMs. Therefore, we also generate various anticommon sense and nonsensical variants of the stories, meant to isolate the effects of memorization. For the anti-commonsensical stories, we randomly do one of the actions: (1) replace the effect variable \\(Y\\) with an unusual attribute, that would not be an effect variable in any of the stories (e.g., \"ear shape\"); or (2) create an irrelevant treatment variable \\(X\\) that does not play a causal role in any of our commonsensical stories, such as \"playing card games\" (see Appendix A.7). For the nonsensical variants, we invent artificial words as variable names such as \"zory\" and \"qixy\" (see Appendix A.6)."

The interesting question to us is whether models can generalize across different query types. Namely, we keep our CAUSALCoT framework, and pretend a reasoning example of query type \\( i \\), and then calculate how much improvement it can bring when models answer new questions of query type \\( j \\). In Figure 5, we can see that conditional probability and NIE are the questions that benefit the most from ICL, and showing examples of marginal probability and ATT are among the most helpful to all questions in general."

According to the authors, this is because there are no possible shortcuts when you consider all possible combinations of queries, graphs and data in this ideal test: due to their combinatorial explosion, the machine can only answer all questions right if it correctly applies causal reasoning. From this point of view, our work constitutes a first step towards a mini-Turing test formulated in natural language. However, we cover only some of the commonly studied causal queries spanning all three rungs. Future work may extend this to further queries, such as, e.g., path-specific effects other than NDE and NIE [52], thereby increasing the number of potential questions and moving closer to the ideal test."

In contrast, our work suggests that LLMs may still be far from reasoning reliably about causality (reaching only \\(60+\\%\\) on CLADDER). As argued in Section 1, we believe that investigating this aspect may be of particular importance, since causal inference is crucial in many policy-relevant scenarios, where reliable AI systems could assist decision-making: from epidemiology [22, 79] to economics [10, 37] to fairness [47, 71]. Testing the abilities of these systems in semi-realistic scenarios is therefore crucial, motivating some of the design choices in our dataset: e.g., the example in Figure 1 was inspired by similar questions which arose in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where incorrect causal reasoning resulted in a fallacy where vaccinations were considered to be harmful instead of beneficial [20, 49]. Further work may be dedicated to making the questions and verbalizations even closer to realistic instances of causal inference problems."

However, even with plug-ins, there are still often \"interface\" failures: that is, \"[the LLM] often has trouble formulating problems in a way that elicits useful answers from the plug-ins\". We hypothesise that something similar would happen for causal inference: even once suitable plug-ins are built, the language-to-tool interface may still be a non-trivial research question."

For ATE questions, we ask whether the treatment \\((X = 1)\\) increases or decreases the likelihood of the effect variable \\(Y = y\\). For adjustment set questions, we ask whether a set of variables should be adjusted for when estimating the causal effect between treatment and effect. By adjusting, we aim to blocked the non-causal paths from the treatments to effect, and hence eliminate spurious correlation. For example, to query whether the set gender is an adjustment set for the effect of a treatment on recovery, we ask \"To estimate the effect of the treatment on recovery, should we directly look at how the treatment correlates with recovery, or should we look at gender-specific correlation?\" In the collider bias questions, similarly to the explaining away questions, we condition on a collider variable and ask about how an intervention on one of the parents (treatment \\(X\\)) affects the other parent (outcome \\(Y\\)). However since by construction \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) do not have common causes, the answer to this question is always \"no\"."

We also introduce some notations to describe the relative positions among the nodes. Following a standard assumption in causality (but see, e.g., [6]), we will assume that \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) is a direct acyclic graph (DAG), where we denote the parents of a node \\( V_i \\) as \\( \\mathbf{PA}(V_i) := \\{V_j | e_{ij} \\in E\\} \\).

We call a node \\( V_k \\) as a confounder (i.e., common cause) of the other two nodes \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) if \\( e_{ki}, e_{kj} \\in E \\); a collider (i.e., common effect) if \\( e_{ik}, e_{jk} \\in E \\); and a mediator if \\( e_{ik}, e_{kj} \\in E \\)."

Differing from conventional metrics, ROSCOE is specifically designed to scrutinize the quality of large language model outputs, focusing on aspects such as semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality, all evaluated within the context of step-by-step reasoning, rather than solely the final response. This allows for a more objective and comprehensive assessment of a model's output, greatly aiding in the verification of its interpretability. The results of this evaluation can be found in Table 8 and Figure 9. We consider the model's performance as unsatisfying if it falls out of the top quantile, namely receiving a score \\( s \\in [0,1] \\) smaller than 0.25 when the score should be minimized, or greater than 0.75 when it should be maximized."

We also check what skill types the dataset tests: the application of causal inference methods (CI Method), formalization of causal queries, causal relation extraction from the given text (Causal RE), and qualitative reasoning."
