However, existing fact-checking systems often lack transparency in their decision-making, making it challenging for users to comprehend their reasoning process. To address this, we propose the Question-guided Multihop Fact-Checking (QCHECK) system, which guides the model's reasoning process by asking a series of questions critical for verifying a claim. QCHECK has five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question-answering module, a QA validator, and a reasoner. Users can input a claim into QCHECK, which then predicts its veracity and provides a comprehensive report detailing its reasoning process, guided by a sequence of (question, answer) pairs. QCHECK also provides the source of evidence supporting each question, fostering a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process."

Afterward, the validator is used to validate the usefulness of the newly-generated (Q, A) pair based on the existing context and the claim, i.e., \\(\\mathcal{V}(c,\\{q,a\\},\\mathcal{C}) \\to \\{\\text{True}, \\text{False}\\}\\).

In this case, the reasoner module is called to utilize the stored relevant context to justify the veracity of the claim and outputs the final label, i.e., \\(\\mathcal{R}(c,\\mathcal{C}) \\to \\{\\text{Supported}, \\text{Refuted}\\}\\).

Recent large language models such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) have demonstrated strong few-shot generalization ability via in-context learning, in which the model can efficiently learn a task when prompted with the instruction of the task together with a small number of demonstrations. We take advantage of InstructGPT's in-context learning ability to implement the claim verifier.

The knowledge can be retrieved by properly prompting the model. Drawing from this insight, we introduce the GPT Reciter-Reader approach. Given a question, we prompt the InstructGPT to \"recite\" the knowledge stored within it, and InstructGPT responds with relevant evidence. The evidence is then fed into a reader model to produce the corresponding answer. While this method, like FLAN-T5, does not rely on a specific corpus, it stands out by using InstructGPT. This offers a more dependable parametric knowledge base than FLAN-T5."

These scores are better than directly using InstructGPT, Codex, or FLAN-T5. They are also on par with the systems that apply claim decomposition strategies, i.e., CoT, and ProgramFC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our QACHECK system. Especially, the QACHECK has better improvement over the end-to-end models on claims with high reasoning depth. This indicates that decomposing a complex claim into simpler steps with question-guided reasoning can facilitate more accurate reasoning."

Specifically, QACHECK iteratively generates contextually relevant questions, retrieves and validates answers, judges the sufficiency of the context information, and finally, reasons out the claim's truth value based on the accumulated knowledge. QACHECK leverages a wide range of techniques, such as in-context learning, document retrieval, and question-answering, to ensure a precise, transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process."

Recognizing the significance of also addressing Not Enough Information claims, we plan to devise strategies to incorporate these in upcoming versions of the system."
