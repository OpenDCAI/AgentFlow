Its high-tech special zone plays host to the likes of Intel chip factories, as well as the Foxconn assembly lines that make many of the world's iPads. The city has also become a hub for software engineers, partly because property prices are dramatically cheaper than those of Beijing and Shanghai (see our chapter on the property market), and likewise its high quality local universities. But the other reason why skilled engineers like the city is its liveability. Famed for its teahouse culture, Chengdu is also a gastronomic capital: Sichuanese cuisine is one of China's four great culinary cultures. Your guide to sampling the best of this spicy cuisine is chef and author Fuschsia Dunlop – the first Westerner to train at Chengdu's celebrated culinary school (she was there in the 1990s and later published a book about the experience). Her restaurant advice can be found in our 'Visitor information' chapter which also offers guidance on how to get around this vast city and what to do there (Chengdu has more than just pandas)."

However, despite the total reinvention of the fabric of the city, Chengdu still has something of its old magic, in the atmosphere, the dialect, the laid-back character of the people, and, of course, the food! People still put out a few tables and chairs and create an impromptu teahouse wherever they can, and talk about food all the time. I am glad that some green spaces have been preserved along the river, and that the Wenshu Monastery, River-Viewing Pavilion Park and the Qingyang Temple, where I used to learn qigong retain their old beauty and distinctiveness."

We would wander around the streets near the Wenshu monastery and try to find some snack-sellers, dropping into a couple of places for a bowl of spicy tofu or some noodles. If they were interested in antiques, I'd take them to the antiques market near Du Fu's thatched cottage. Foodwise, we'd have one amazing banquet at Yu Zhi Lan, and a riotous hotspot supper.

It is useful to know that on formal occasions Chinese people don't tend to drink alcohol on their own and at their own pace, but only as part of toasts with other guests: so it's more polite to wait until someone invites you to have a sip, or to invite one or more other guests to drink with you. If you are helping yourself to food from common dishes with your own chopsticks, you don't want to rummage around or touch pieces of food that you will not be eating yourself – but I think this is just basic good manners. People will, of course, be delighted if you appreciate the food! Toasting with hard liquor is one of the perils of formal Chinese dinners, especially for men, but I think the pressure to drink is less intense than it used to be. Some Chinese people I know who dine out regularly do not drink at all, toasting instead with soft drinks, and they seem to get away with it. It's easier for a woman to decline alcoholic toasts than a man. But it's worth knowing that if you do start toasting with bajiiu, you will probably be forced to continue until the bitter end!"

Sichuanese chefs are renowned for their mastery of multi-layered flavours (fu he wei) in which the drama of spice and tingle is always balanced by gentler tastes. Even where chillies are used, they are employed with such variety that their taste never palls. They may be fresh, dried, pickled or ground, and used in every combination from the notorious mala ('numbing-and-hot') pairing of dried chillies and Sichuan pepper to the sweet, seductive 'fish-fragrant' flavour (see below). A well-planned Sichuanese meal should be a thrilling rollercoaster of tastes, with a mixture of spicy dishes, simple stir-fried greens and refreshing, lightly-seasoned broths."

The \"beach\" is just yellow floor, but it received a lot of press attention for its size, stretching over 5,000 square metres. And the surf is provided periodically by a wave machine (life jackets are compulsory, since many Chinese have never learned to swim). Certainly it's a sight to behold, if not quite the \"tropical paradise\" the waterpark promises in its name."
