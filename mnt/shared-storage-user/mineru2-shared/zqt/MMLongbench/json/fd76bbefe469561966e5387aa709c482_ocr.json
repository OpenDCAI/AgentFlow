The latter (with its subordinate marl-slate) rests, the very irregular and sometimes absent yellow sands of the Permian alone intervening, upon a denuded surface of Coal-Measures. The total thickness of the Magnesian Limestone at its maximum may be estimated as being not much over 600 feet, but at Sunderland the uppermost portion of the deposit is absent. The amount of that rock present there is between 300 and 400 feet. There is very little southerly dip in the limestone, but there is some, and the best way to ascertain the nature of those portions which underlie the town is therefore to study the beds as they crop out in the beautiful cliff sections to the north, between the Wear and the Tyne. These rocks are so strange in structure, and so striking by reason of the variety of their forms, that they have been described in many valuable papers, by the late Professor Sedgwick, Mr. R. Howse, Mr. J. W. Kirkby, and others.* It is not intended in the present paper to repeat what has been so well and so often said before, but simply to draw special attention to one of the strangest and most striking of the developments of the Magnesian Limestone as displayed in Marsden Bay."

The fragments are, in fact, of the same material as the solid rock forming the mass of the cliff—Magnesian Limestone. Moreover, the cementing matter which binds the fragments together—and binds them so closely that it is sometimes easier to break the enclosed stones than the cement that holds them—is Magnesian Limestone too. But yet there is a difference. For whereas the broken bits of rock have all the varying character of structure and texture of the neighbouring beds from which they have clearly been detached, the matrix in which they lie is more or less amorphous. These breccias are exposed on the cliff-face between walls of ordinarily bedded Magnesian Limestone, and present the following peculiarities:—Sometimes they fill a mere fissure, a few feet at most in width; sometimes a broad one many yards across. Sometimes a breccia-filled fissure is nearly of equal breadth from top to bottom of the cliff; sometimes its upper termination (which is almost invariably broad) and sometimes its lower extremity (which is almost invariably narrow) is exposed in the cliff; sometimes—though more rarely—both top and bottom are shown. In some cases the broken fragments within the fissures can be traced graduating through semibrecciated portions of beds to wholly undisturbed strata in the walls or fissure-cheeks. When the top of a fissure is exposed in section the breccia is also seen usually to pass gradually upwards, first into semi-brecciated matter, and finally to undisturbed or only slightly synclinal beds bridging over the mass of broken rock. Where the entire transverse section of a fissure is exposed it is seen to be a deep V-shaped ravine or gullet, tapering to a point below, and the rocks below it are wholly undisturbed. Such a case is well shown very near the inn in the cliff."

These disturbances have, it is true, been repeatedly called “earthquakes” and “shocks” in the local papers, and it must be admitted that some shaking of the surface and shocks to the dwellers in the affected areas did undoubtedly form part of the manifestations. But the evidences of deep-seated action, and of wide-spread effects due to it, which are characteristic of true earthquakes, have been remarkably absent in all published and unpublished records of the occurrences. Indeed, the disturbances have been singularly local—limited almost entirely to the Tunstall Road neighbourhood of Sunderland, and, it would appear, to certain linear directions within that district. For some months the writer has been kept informed of the successive “shocks” through the kindness of several gentlemen, among whom Professor G. S. Brady, F.R.S., Mr. J. B. Atkinson, Mr. W. S. Harrison, B.A., A.Sc., Mr. C. L. Cummings, and Mr. G. Shaw must be specially mentioned. The results of the information thus gathered from various and independent quarters are briefly as follows: —"

Lastly, that though in most cases there has been no difficulty in getting plenty of corroborative evidence as to the character, time of occurrence, and duration of the more severe shakes, many persons residing within quite a short distance from the line of greatest force have felt or noticed nothing."

Remarkable examples of these occur on the coast between the Tyne and the Wear, one of the best being the “Chimney” just to the south of Marsden grotto. The remarkable appearances presented by these breccias at Marsden may, we think, be explained by the filling up of large fissures and chasms with broken fragments of the superincumbent strata, and may perhaps be safely attributed to earthquake action on these rocks at an early period.”‡"

This answer, coupled with the great depth of the colliery in question, satisfactorily settled the underground shot-firing theory; but in his letter Mr. Parrington suggested another to take its place, and attributed the occurrences to the existence of natural water-blasts in the body of the Magnesian Limestone. Others, also well acquainted with that rock, have adopted that view."

But the larger cavities are often true caverns formed by the double action of mechanical and chemical agencies, and that these agencies are still at work in the manufacture of such caverns there is abundant evidence to show. How readily the Magnesian Limestone is acted on by mechanical agents of denudation and waste is shown by the numerous caves along the shore. All these combine the typical characters of seu-caves as enumerated by Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., viz., they have flat or scarcely sloping floors, and are usually widest below. They seldom penetrate far into the cliff, and their entrances are in the same horizontal plane (that of the beach at high-water line, whether that beach be the present one, or an ancient one or"

But these sea-margin caverns are insignificant when compared with the countless gullies, gashes, and holes of every description which cut the internal body of the limestone through and through. The history of the latter is different. Many of them may be accounted for by noting how frequently masses both large and small and of the most irregular forms of soft pulverulent earthy matter occur in the midst of the hardest and most compact portions of the limestone. An afternoon's walk along the face of the South Shields quarries, between that town and Marsden Bay, will render this sudden utter change of texture in the stone patent to any one. How easily such soft and incoherent material can be removed by the merest percolation of rain-water needs no proof, and that caverns would result and have resulted from such removal is also clear. This action is indeed chiefly mechanical, but there is also going on at the same time in the limestone a continual destruction of its substance as rock by the purely chemical ordinary action of rain-water on limestone. How great this action really is may perhaps be best understood when it is stated that in every thousand gallons of Sunderland water there is nearly one pound of lime and magnesia; or, in other words, every thousand gallons of that water pumped up represents a pound weight of rock abstracted.† In the course of a year the amount of hard compact Magnesian Limestone carried away by the Water Company's works would not fall much short of forty cubic yards. If to this be added the amount of water similarly charged with lime and magnesia, which runs off to the sea from springs, streams, and rivers, the enormous amount of stone annually lost by the Permian series in East Durham can be better imagined than represented by figures. A cubic foot of Magnesian Limestone of the less crystalline varieties when saturated holds from 3·45 lbs. to 17 lbs. of water; the crystalline forms hold very little.‡ This bears out the statement made twenty years ago in these Transactions by Messrs. Daglish and Forster, and confirmed by all subsequent experience, that the feeders of water met with in sinking through the Magnesian"

He had had a conversation on the subject a short time ago with Professor Warington Smyth, who made an apt remark—that if air pent up in small water-pipes could make the noises and shocks they knew it did, how much more would it do so in large spaces like these fissures. In the neighbourhood where Mr. Cummings, unfortunately for himself, lived, there was something like 60 fathoms of limestone; the head of the water was about 20 fathoms below the surface, and there was, therefore, about 40 fathoms of water. He had information—and he would have liked to have asked the Sunderland Water Company's officials if it was correct—that the level of the water varied 14 fathoms between night and morning. If this was the case he thought it reasonable to suppose that, the water rising 14 fathoms in a chain of gullets which probably existed in that district, and the air escaping after being pent up to a high pressure at the top of these gullets, would have the effect which, unfortunately, causes annoyance to the residents in the neighbourhood."

The water, of course, helped to support the walls where it filled these gullets, and when the water was withdrawn, so much support was also withdrawn from the walls, and they were more apt to collapse. If any one could give any clear and distinct information that such a tremendous rise and fall of water, as mentioned by Mr. Parrington, took place by the action of the Water Company pumping, that would show excellent cause for the increased occurrence of such falls of stone. The last speaker asked why he (Professor Lebour) thought these falls would happen more frequently in the future. Simply because these gullets were slowly becoming larger and larger daily. It was fortunate that they had Mr. Forster and Mr. Daglish present on this occasion, as they were the authors of, he might say, the best paper on the limestone of Durham which had appeared in the Transactions on this subject. Professor Merivale asked why Brecci-gashes were pointed at the bottom. It was because they were to all intents and purposes water channels. The tendency of water was to fall to a lower level, and to dig a channel deeper and deeper. There was among these gullets a kind of underground river-system, though not"
