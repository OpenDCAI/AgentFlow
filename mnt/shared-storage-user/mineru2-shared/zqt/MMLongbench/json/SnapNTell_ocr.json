Despite these advancements, VLLMs still encounter substantial difficulties in handling queries involving long-tail entities, with a tendency to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluative benchmark named SnapNTell, specifically tailored for entity-centric VQA. This task aims to test the models' capabilities in identifying entities and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge. We have developed the SnapNTell Dataset, distinct from traditional VQA datasets: (1) It encompasses a wide range of categorized entities, each represented by images and explicitly named in the answers; (2) It features QA pairs that require extensive knowledge for accurate responses. The dataset is organized into 22 major categories, containing 7,568 unique entities in total. For each entity, we curated 10 illustrative images and crafted 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs. To address this novel task, we devised a scalable, efficient, and transparent retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM. Our approach markedly outperforms existing methods on the SnapNTell dataset, achieving a \\(66.5\\%\\) improvement in the BELURT score. We will soon make the dataset and the source code publicly accessible."

ManyModalQA (Hannan et al., 2020) shifts the focus to answer modality selection, MIMOQA (Singh et al., 2021) emphasizes multimodal answer extraction, and WebQA (Chang et al., 2021) introduces real-world knowledge-seeking questions, albeit with some limitations regarding entity categorization and granularity.

We have identified 22 categories that adequately represent a cross-section of entities one might encounter in daily life. These categories include landmark, painting, sculpture, food, fruit, vegetable, mammal, amphibian, insect, fish, bird, reptile, celebrity, instrument, plant, electronics, tool, transportation, sport, book, household, and car.

The responsibilities of these annotators include: (1) ensuring that the images and QA pairs are semantically aligned, (2) validating the accuracy of the provided answers, (3) making sure the questions are free of particular entity names but demanding such specificity in the answers, (4) assessing if the modified QA pairs adhere to the criteria for knowledge-intensive content, and (5) removing specific entity-related details from the questions.

As demonstrated in Figure 11 in Appendix F, we use the average Wikipedia pageviews per entity over the last 60 days as the metric. This average is calculated by summing up the pageviews and then dividing by the number of entities. The insights from Figure 11 reveal that entities in the celebrity category have the highest average popularity. For a broader comparison among different categories, we also present a comprehensive analysis of total pageviews for all categories in Figure 10 in Appendix F, which shows that the celebrity category remains at the forefront in terms of overall entity popularity. This is attributed to the combination of a higher number of entities in this category and the generally higher popularity of each entity within it."

Our database, built on the WIT dataset (Srinivasan et al., 2021), maps CLIP image embeddings to their text descriptions, leveraging Faiss's robust similarity search capabilities. After setting up the indexing database, given an input query image \\(I\\), we perform a \\(k\\)-nearest neighbor retrieval based on cosine similarity. The retrieval outcomes are represented as \\(\\mathcal{R}(I) = \\{(i_1, c_1), \\dots, (i_k, c_k)\\}\\), where for each \\(j\\) within the range of 1 to \\(k\\), \\(i_j\\) and \\(c_j\\) correspond to the retrieved image and its associated caption, respectively. By comparing \\(I\\) with similar images from the database, we identify the entity in the image region, which enables precise image-level entity recognition."

Significant resources are essential to scale pre-training to 70 billion parameter models on a substantial dataset of over 200 million instances. Often, this necessitates the utilization of an FSDP wrapper, as outlined in Dettmers et al. (2023), to distribute the model across multiple GPUs efficiently. To optimize our training process, we employ quantization strategies, specifically 4-bit and 8-bit quantization techniques (Dettmers et al., 2023), within our multimodal framework. In this approach, we maintain the LLM component of our model in a frozen state, allowing only the image modality tokenizers to be trainable. This strategy drastically reduces the memory requirements by an order of magnitude. As a result of these optimizations, we can successfully train a 70 billion parameter model on a single GPU with 80GB VRAM, using a batch size of 4."

This task is designed to test models on entity recognition and their ability to provide detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses. We collected a unique evaluation dataset for this task, which distinguishes itself from existing VQA datasets by including a wide array of fine-grained categorized entities, supported by images and explicit entity mentions in the answers. This dataset emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses over simple binary answers. In addition, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM solution for the SnapNTell task as an effective baseline.

Instead, we opt to initially extract the image region containing the entity and utilize this specific region in subsequent recognition processes to enhance accuracy. During this phase, we leverage a language-guided object detection model, i.e., GLIP (Li et al., 2021), to extract meaningful regions from complex images. This approach helps precisely identify and extract image regions directly relevant to specific textual queries. It accomplishes this by understanding the context of the query and adjusting its object detection method to find the most"

This approach not only accelerates convergence compared to training the model from scratch but also allows the model to inherit the reasoning capabilities of the LLM during inference.

This integration can be accomplished through methods such as adapter-based tuning (Alayrac et al., 2022), which fine-tunes a small portion of the model to process visual inputs, or prefix tuning (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021), where trained prefixed vectors are inputted to guide the frozen LLM towards contextually relevant text outputs based on the visual data.
