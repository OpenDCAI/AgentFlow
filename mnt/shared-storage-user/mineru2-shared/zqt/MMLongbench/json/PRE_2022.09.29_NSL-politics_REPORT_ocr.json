For example, most Hispanics say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, but views vary across religious and age groups. And on guns, Hispanics favor controlling gun ownership at higher rates than the general public. These findings come after the Supreme Court recently made major decisions on cases that resulted in restricted access to legal abortions and expanded rights to carry guns in public. When it comes to immigration, a majority of Hispanics say it is a very important policy goal to create a path to legal status for immigrants who arrived illegally to the U.S. as children – a greater share than among the U.S. public overall."

For all other weighting dimensions, the more recent panelist measurements were used. For American Trends panelists recruited in 2021, the 2020 volunteerism measure was imputed using data from existing panelists with similar characteristics. This ensures that any patterns of change that were observed in the existing panelists were also reflected in the new recruits when the weighting was performed."

The San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley metropolitan area in California is one of the most expensive areas, with a price level that is \\(17.4\\%\\) higher than the national average. Income in the sample is adjusted to make up for this difference.
