Events will include visits to museums, Black-owned restaurants, historical landmarks, and culturally related art shows. While this community's intent is to shine a light on the fruits of the Black diaspora, it will also explore the very real everyday implications of being Black in America with a spotlight on maintaining wellness while being socially aware. Our hope is that this will be a space of celebration and connection for students in search of representation across campus."

So, the juxtaposition of extreme wealth and extreme poverty is going to be such a defining feature of your life in NYC that it might start to seem like a normal state of affairs. However, students who join this community choose not to normalize this strange situation, but rather to examine it more closely. Through service-learning, participation in cultural events, and compelling conversations with professionals, activists, and each other, you will create opportunities to learn and to educate. We will think about how the distribution of resources is determined not only by the dynamics of the market, but also by the gendered and racialized status-structures we have inherited. We'll think about the immediate material consequences of economic inequality on poorer New Yorkers and its longer-term impact on the social cohesion, peace, and health of the entire community. Above all, you'll think about how things could be different and might be changed."

That is why when you first get here, you should get involved on your campus. You shouldn't be afraid to meet new people. By getting involved (either joining a club, your halls hall council, or other social groups) it forces you to meet and spend time with others from all different backgrounds. You'll probably even share similar interests, values, and goals with many of the people you come across. This will allow you the opportunity to form friendships and expand your social circle. In this way, you will get closer contact with faculty, members of the community, and fellow students. You'll also begin to build a connection with your school and the university. So don't be afraid to branch out of your comfort zone and discover what the University has to offer."

We encourage you to get involved in your residence hall council by running for an elected position or simply engaging in programming, service, and advocacy. NYU's Inter-Residence Hall Council (IRHC) is another way to get involved in the greater NYU community. IRHC's three pillars are student advocacy, service, and community events. IRHC hosts many community events including Welcome Week, service weeks, Town Halls, FLURRY ice skating event in Central Park, UltraViolet Live talent competition, and a semi-formal dance at an iconic NYC venue. The National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) is another way to get involved on campus. NRHH focuses on recognizing residential students who go above and beyond. Your NYU experience begins the day you move into your residence hall. Take advantage of this great community by getting connected!"
