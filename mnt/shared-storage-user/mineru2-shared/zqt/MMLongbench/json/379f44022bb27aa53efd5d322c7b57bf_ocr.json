The celebration changed the atmosphere in the lounge where it took place and people visibly brightened and became more animated, chatting to each other and sharing the snacks. Two people were in another lounge from which the singing and chat could be heard. A member of staff came into the lounge and offered one person a glass of sherry. They did not offer the other person either a drink or the snacks, nor invite them both to move to the main lounge for the celebration if they wanted to. The care plan for one of the people stated they needed encouragement to join in activities as they were at risk of social isolation. Staff failed to follow the care plan and ensure people were invited to share in social activity.

But I have no complaints\", and, \"I came in for six weeks, and decide to stay, so I have no complaints; if I had, I would speak to the manager or any of the girls.\" The provider had a complaints policy in place and information about how to complain was included in the guide in each person's room. The policy was not specific about when a person could expect a response to their complaint. The policy stated if people were not satisfied with the registered manager's response they could escalate their complaint to the provider, but the provider's contact details were not shown. The policy stated people could also contact the local authority and / or CQC but there were no telephone numbers for these. A complaint received had been responded to in a timely manner however, the response did not inform the person how to escalate their complaint if they wished to."
