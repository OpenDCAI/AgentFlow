We address this problem by introducing a novel method to automatically extract personality profiles from public product review text. We then design and assess three context-aware recommendation architectures that leverage the profiles to test our hypothesis."

In our work here, we use the Receptiviti API, because it is a widely-validated and widely-used psychology-based language analysis platform for understanding human emotion, personality, motivation, and psychology from language. Receptiviti's API outputs scores for the commonly-used OCEAN personality model: five values, one for each of the five personality aspects of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (each corresponding to one letter of “OCEAN”). Finally, this inferred personality is fed as input to a recommendation system, to test whether it can improve recommendation performance."

For example, an introverted engineer might think he is an extrovert if he/she is working with a group of individuals that may be more introverted. Consequently, the results of questionnaires are often hard to reproduce.

To make personality detection more convenient and reproducible, practitioners prefer automated personality detection, which infers a personality type based on user data. Such methods are less accurate than personality questionnaires — as it relies on the input user data manifesting personality traits — but has the advantage of not requiring inputs to be answers to questionnaires. For example, social media posts that exhibit opinions and viewpoints are a prime source of text data useful for personality detection. Individuals have different language use behaviors that reveal personality traits [10]. Automatic, text-based personality detection infer users' personalities by analyzing users' word choice (lexical selection) and sentence structure (grammatical selection). Such technology has been sufficiently proven, making them commonplace and deployed at scale in production, and available as a service through cloud-based application APIs."

While large-scale recommendation datasets exist, they universally lack users' personality information. It is infeasible to ask to obtain this information via questionnaires since the identity of users is usually confidential. Therefore, we utilize automatic personality detection to infer personality from product reviews written by users. Product reviews are ideal: they are widely available on online commercial websites, they often demonstrate personality traits, and they are public (the texts are meant to be read by others). Hence, they can serve as a good source for automatically detecting personality in an economic but accurate way."

This may make sense when certain items are used primarily by certain personality types (as in computer games) but are less compelling for items that may be used by many personality types. Lastly, in social media recommendations, Wu et al. [22] proposed an approach for recommending interest groups by integrating personality.

Different from the methods above, we propose two novel ways of adding personality features into the recommendation system: 1) taking the most salient personality trait as a learnable vector and 2) calculating a user's personality embedding as a weighted sum of a user's OCEAN personality features, which is a learnable embedding within the recommendation system."

For example, people with a high degree of openness like to listen to rock music, while neurotic people like jazz. Therefore, we choose music as one of the domains to be studied. In order to study the role of personality in different domains, we randomly select beauty for comparison.

Since there are over 2,500 users in total in our two constructed datasets, it is time-consuming to manually evaluate them all. As a compromise, we choose to manually examine the users that receive extremely high scores for certain personality traits. We believe those examples are more easily evaluated by humans. Specifically, for each personality trait, we select the users that receive the top 10 highest scores on this type. We analyze both the Amazon-beauty and the Amazon-music datasets, resulting in a total of 100 samples. These samples are evaluated by two graduate students. Both were trained with a detailed explanation of the OCEAN personality model. We ask them to choose whether the sampled review texts accurately match their inferred personality, choosing between three options of yes, no, or not sure. We then calculate the accuracy of the samples and the inter-annotator agreement between the two annotators using Cohen's Kappa [5]. We find that the inferred personality matches with the review text in \\(81\\%\\) of the Amazon-beauty samples, and \\(79\\%\\) of the samples from Amazon-music. The average Cohen's Kappa is 0.70. We take this to indicate that the Receptiviti API can indeed infer users' personality traits from review texts with generally high accuracy."

Conscientious people usually talk about their own experience and feelings before recommending the items to others, e.g., \"I have had this shower gel once before\" or \"Don't just take my word for it\".

There are more instances of people with certain personality traits (e.g., agreeableness) than others (e.g., neuroticism). A possible reason is that people with certain personalities are more willing to write product reviews. 2) The distributions for the two domains are generally the same, with higher agreeable scores and lower neurotic scores. However, there is a slight difference. For example, the scores of extroverts in music are generally higher than that in the beauty domain. This could be explained by the possibility that people who are passionate about music may be more emotional."

More advanced models graph recommendation models can be used in the future. Third, we conduct empirical experiments on whether personality information benefits recommendation. However, more in-depth investigation is necessary on how personality affects recommendation and users' behavior. In the future, we could conduct a user study to find the causal relationship between personality and recommendation. To be specific, we can develop different marketing strategies for users with different personalities. By observing the effects of different strategies on users' behavior, we can gain a better understanding of how personality affects recommendation. Fourth, we find that the openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism features do not have a noticeable impact on the recommendation performance. A possible reason is that OCEAN only contains five types of personality, which might be insufficient to provide enough useful signals to recommendations. A possible solution is to use a more fine-grained personality model than OCEAN; e.g., the MBTI personality model which has a richer, 16-facet personality profile."

We first construct two new datasets based on the Amazon dataset in the beauty and music domains and include OCEAN personality scores automatically inferred by the Receptiviti API, a commercial service. We then analyze the accuracy of using texts to obtain personality profiles and output personality score distributions. To explore the effectiveness of using personality in current recommendation systems, we conduct a few experiments with the standard neural collaborative filtering (NCF) recommendation algorithm and our variants, finding that incorporating personality information improves recommendation performance by \\(3\\%\\) to \\(28\\%\\). In terms of the relationship between personality and domain, we find that openness, extroversion, and agreeableness are helpful in music recommendation, while conscientiousness is most helpful in the beauty recommendation."
