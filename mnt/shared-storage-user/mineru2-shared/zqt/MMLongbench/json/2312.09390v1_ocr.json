However, future superhuman models will behave in complex ways too difficult for humans to reliably evaluate; humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models. We study an analogy to this problem: can weak model supervision elicit the full capabilities of a much stronger model? We test this using a range of pretrained language models in the GPT-4 family on natural language processing (NLP), chess, and reward modeling tasks. We find that when we naively finetune strong pretrained models on labels generated by a weak model, they consistently perform better than their weak supervisors, a phenomenon we call weak-to-strong generalization. However, we are still far from recovering the full capabilities of strong models with naive finetuning alone, suggesting that techniques like RLHF may scale poorly to superhuman models without further work. We find that simple methods can often significantly improve weak-to-strong generalization: for example, when finetuning GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level supervisor and an auxiliary confidence loss, we can recover close to GPT-3.5-level performance on NLP tasks. Our results suggest that it is feasible to make empirical progress today on a fundamental challenge of aligning superhuman models."

On the other hand, strong pretrained models should already have good representations of the alignment-relevant tasks we care about. For example, if a model can generate complicated code, then it should intuitively also know whether that code faithfully adheres to the user's instructions. As a result, for the purposes of alignment we do not need the weak supervisor to teach the strong model new capabilities; instead, we simply need the weak supervisor to elicit what the strong model already knows. This gives us hope that the strong model can generalize beyond the weak supervision, solving even hard problems for which the weak supervisor can only give incomplete or flawed training labels.

Weak-to-strong learning is a special type of weakly supervised learning—a setting in which models are trained using unreliable labels (Bach et al., 2017; Ratner et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018). There is also a rich literature on the related problem of learning from noisy labels (Song et al., 2022). Common methods include bootstrapping (Reed et al., 2014; Han et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020), noise-robust losses (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020), and noise modeling (Yi & Wu, 2019). Unlike most work on label noise, the errors in our weak supervision are much harder to address than uniform label noise, instead having \"instance-dependent\" errors (Frenay & Verleysen, 2013). Semi-supervised learning, in which labels are only available for a subset of the data, is also closely related (Kingma et al., 2014; Laine & Aila, 2016; Berthelot et al., 2019). We could also study our problem in a semi-supervised setting by having an \"easy\" subset of examples that weak supervisors provide reliable labels for and a subset of unlabeled \"hard\" examples that the weak supervisor can't reliably label, a problem which we call \"easy-to-hard generalization\" (see Appendix C)."

Despite these differences with past work, we expect many methods from semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation to translate to our setting.

A critical step of RLHF is to train a reward model (RM) to predict human preferences between model responses. Specifically, a reward model is trained on a dataset consisting of dialogs between a human and an assistant model. For each query, the humans compare multiple possible responses (completions) from the assistant, providing human preference data. Then, a reward model is trained to predict the results of pairwise comparisons between completions. Finally, the assistant model is trained by optimizing against the reward model with reinforcement learning (RL). In our work, we do not study the RL step, and instead assume the goal is to maximize reward model accuracy. For more details on reward models, see e.g. Ouyang et al. (2022). We use a proprietary dataset used to train ChatGPT reward models."

In particular, if the weak labels contain systematic errors that are easy to learn, the strong model could learn to imitate those errors. This is also a concern raised in theoretical work on superalignment, which has argued that the human simulator failure mode could be important: naive human supervision might result in superhuman models learning to imitate what a human would say, rather than outputting its best predictions (Christiano et al., 2022)."

However future superhuman models may never directly observe superhuman alignment-relevant capabilities; these capabilities may be predominantly \"latent\", e.g. learned through self-supervised learning or reinforcement learning rather than through imitation learning.

We apply various preprocessing to the datasets. For example, some tasks are in FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) and we use their preprocessing. For ANLI we group neutral entailments with contradictions. We convert each dataset to a binary classification problem. For multiple-choice datasets, suppose each datapoint has a question \\( Q \\) and multiple candidate answers \\( A_{1},\\ldots ,A_{k} \\). We then convert this datapoint to \\( k \\) new datapoints of the form \\( (Q,A_{i}) \\), where the label is 0 for all incorrect answers \\( A_{i} \\) and 1 for the correct answers. In this procedure, we also aim to maintain class balance, so we keep the same number of correct and wrong answers per question<sup>6</sup>. We are also additionally rebalancing the classes in datasets where one of the classes represents more than \\( 55\\% \\) of the data. To do so, we randomly drop datapoints from the dominant class, so that the classes are perfectly balanced."

We note that only games with players of Elo 1800 or higher were included in pretraining. These games still include the moves that were played in-game, rather than the best moves in the corresponding positions. On the other hand, the chess puzzles require the model to predict the best move. We use the dataset originally introduced in Schwarzschild et al. (2021b) which is sourced from https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles (see also Schwarzschild et al., 2021a). We only evaluate the models ability to predict the first move of the puzzle (some of the puzzles require making multiple moves). We follow the pretraining format, and convert each puzzle to a list of moves leading up to the puzzle position, as illustrated in Figure 14. We use \\(50k\\) puzzles sampled randomly from the dataset as the training set for the weak models and another \\(50k\\) for weak-to-strong finetuning, and evaluate on \\(5k\\) puzzles. For bootstrapping (Section 4.3.1), we use a new set of \\(50k\\) puzzles from the same distribution for each step of the process."

Specifically, we generate weak labels by randomly flipping the labels to match the accuracy of the weak models from the previous experiment. As a result, we get weak labels with the same accuracy, but which are completely unpredictable. In Figure 24(b,e), when we train the student model on the these weak labels, we can get substantially higher accuracy than the accuracy of the weak labels. In other words, if the errors of the weak supervisor are completely unpredictable (random) for the student, with enough data we should be able to recover good generalization, substantially exceeding the performance of the supervisor."

The simple experiment in this section suggests that in addition to the weak label accuracy, it is important to consider the structure of weak errors. In particular, if the weak errors are extremely easy for the strong model to simulate, the student may not generalize much better than the weak supervisor with naive finetuning on the weak labels. On the other hand, if the mistakes of the weak supervisor are completely unpredictable, the student can denoise the predictions of the supervisor and generalize better. In future work, we believe it is important to consider various types of weak supervision with different structures of mistakes, and build a better understanding of how they affect weak-to-strong generalization."
