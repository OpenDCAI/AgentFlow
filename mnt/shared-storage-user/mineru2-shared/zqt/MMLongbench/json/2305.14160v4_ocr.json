However, the underlying mechanism of how LLMs learn from the provided context remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the working mechanism of ICL through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that label words in the demonstration examples function as anchors: (1) semantic information aggregates into label word representations during the shallow computation layers' processing; (2) the consolidated information in label words serves as a reference for LLMs' final predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce an anchor re-weighting method to improve ICL performance, a demonstration compression technique to expedite inference, and an analysis framework for diagnosing ICL errors in GPT2-XL. The promising applications of our findings again validate the uncovered ICL working mechanism and pave the way for future studies.\\(^{1}\\)"

Since ICL does not require updates to millions or trillions of model parameters and relies on human-understandable natural language instructions (Dong et al., 2023), it has become a promising approach for harnessing the full potentiality of LLMs. Despite its significance, the inner working mechanism of ICL remains an open question, garnering considerable interest from research"

This indicates that label words collect useful information during forward propagation in shallow layers. (2) We investigate the relationship between the attention distributions on the label words of the target position and the model's final prediction. Our results illustrate a strong positive correlation, where a candidate label's probability increases with more attention weight on its corresponding label token. In summary, these experimental findings suggest that our hypothesis holds well with large language models on real-world datasets."

For datasets, we use Stanford Sentiment Treebank Binary (SST-2) (Socher et al., 2013) for sentiment analysis, Text REtrieval Conference Question Classification (TREC) (Li and Roth, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001) for question type classification, AG's news topic classification dataset (AGNews) (Zhang et al., 2015) for topic classification, and EmoContext (EmoC) (Chatterjee et al., 2019) for emotion classification.

(2020) points out, attention should be multiplied by the norm of the key vector to yield 'more interpretable attention'.

Besides, adding more demonstrations for vanilla ICL may not bring a stable accuracy boost due to the potential noise introduced, as discussed in Zhao et al. (2021). Different from vanilla ICL which utilizes the extra examples to form a demonstration, we train a re-weighting vector \\(\\beta\\) to modulate label anchor contributions. This shortens the input context and thus brings (almost) no extra cost to the inference speed. The consistent improvements of our method suggest that the re-weighting mechanism could be a better alternative to utilize demonstration examples. Furthermore, it reiterates the crucial role that anchors play in ICL."

By leveraging our defined degree of confusion, \\(\\mathrm{Confusion}_{ij}\\), we can implicitly alleviate the disturbances arising from insufficient probability calibration on the output labels. This allows for a more accurate representation of the model's degree of confusion for different categories, mitigating the impact of randomness."
