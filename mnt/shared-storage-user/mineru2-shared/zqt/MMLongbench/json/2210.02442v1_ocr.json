Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10-LT and three medical imaging datasets (i.e. Colon Pathology, Abdominal CT, and Blood Cell Microscope). Our initial query not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

Active learning promises to improve annotation efficiency by iteratively selecting the most important data to annotate. However, we uncover a striking contradiction to this promise: Active learning fails to select data as effectively as random selection at the first choice. We identify this as the cold start problem in vision active learning and illustrate the problem using three medical imaging applications (Figure 1a-c) as well as a natural imaging application (Figure 1d). Cold start is a crucial topic [54 30] because a performant initial query can lead to noticeably improved subsequent cycle performance in the active learning procedure, evidenced in §3.3. There is a lack of studies that systematically illustrate the cold start problem, investigate its causes, and provide practical solutions to address it. To this end, we ask: What causes the cold start problem and how can we select the initial query when there is no labeled data available?"

Therefore, a large body of existing work selects the initial query randomly [10, 61, 55, 62, 18, 17, 42, 24, 22, 60], highlighting that active querying compromises accuracy and diversity compared to random sampling at the beginning of active learning [36, 63, 44, 11, 20, 59]. Why? We attribute the causes of the cold start problem to the following two aspects:"

Empirically, Figure2 reveals that the class distribution in the selected query is highly unbalanced. These active querying strategies (e.g. Entropy, Margin, VAAL, etc.) can barely outperform random sampling at the beginning because some classes are simply not selected for training. It is because data of the minority classes occurs much less frequently than those of the majority classes. Moreover, datasets in practice are often highly unbalanced, particularly in medical images [32 58]. This can escalate the biased sampling. We hypothesize that the label diversity of a query is an important criterion to determine the importance of the annotation. To evaluate this hypothesis theoretically, we explore the upper bound performance by enforcing a uniform distribution using ground truth (Table1). To evaluate this hypothesis practically, we pursue the label diversity by exploiting the pseudo-labels generated by \\(K\\)-means clustering (Table2). The label diversity can reduce the redundancy in the selection of majority classes, and increase the diversity by including data of minority classes."

For example, to calculate the value of Entropy, a trained classifier is required to predict logits of the data. However, there is no such classifier at the start of active learning, at which point no labeled data is available for training. To express informative features for reliable predictions, we consider contrastive learning, which can be trained using unlabeled data only. Contrastive learning encourages models to discriminate between data augmented from the same image and data from different images [15] [13]. Such a learning process is called instance discrimination. We hypothesize that instance discrimination can act as an alternative to select typical data and eliminate outliers. Specifically, the data that is hard to discriminate from others could be considered as typical data. With the help of Dataset Maps [48] [26] we evaluate this hypothesis and propose a novel active querying strategy that can effectively select typical data (hard-to-contrast data in our definition, see §2.2) and reduce outliers."

When the cold start problem was first observed in recommender systems, there were several solutions to remedy the insufficient information due to the lack of user history [63, 23]. In natural language processing (NLP), Yuan et al. [55] were among the first to address the cold start problem by pre-training models using self-supervision. They attributed the cold start problem to model instability and data scarcity. Vision active learning has shown higher performance than random selection [61, 47, 18, 2, 43, 34, 62], but there is limited study discussing how to select the initial query when facing the entire unlabeled dataset. A few studies somewhat indicated the existence of the cold start problem: Lang et al. [30] explored the effectiveness of the \\( K \\)-center algorithm [16] to select the initial queries. Similarly, Pourahmadi et al. [38] showed that a simple \\( K \\)-means clustering algorithm worked fairly well at the beginning of active learning, as it was capable of covering diverse classes and selecting a similar number of data per class. Most recently, a series of studies [20, 54, 46, 37] continued to propose new strategies for selecting the initial query from the entire unlabeled data and highlighted that typical data (defined in varying ways) could significantly improve the learning efficiency of active learning at a low budget. In addition to the existing publications, our study justifies the two causes of the cold start problem, systematically presents the existence of the problem in six dominant strategies, and produces a comprehensive guideline of initial query selection."

Therefore, we exploit pseudo-labels generated by a simple \\(K\\)-means clustering algorithm and select an equal number of data from each cluster to form the initial query to facilitate label diversity. Without knowledge about the exact number of ground-truth classes, over-clustering is suggested in recent works [51, 57] to increase performances on the datasets with higher intra-class variance.

As seen, even with a relatively larger initial query budget (40,498 images, \\(45\\%\\) of the dataset), most active querying strategies are biased towards certain classes in the PathMNIST dataset. For example, VAAL prefers selecting data in the muscle class, but largely ignores data in the mucus and mucosa classes. On the contrary, our querying strategy selects more data from minority classes (e.g., mucus and mucosa) while retaining the class distribution of major classes. Similar observations in OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST are shown in Appendix Figure7 The higher the entropy is, the more balanced the class distribution is."

To find these typical data, we modify the original Dataset Map by replacing the ground truth term with a pseudo-label term. This modification is made because ground truths are unknown in the active learning setting but pseudo-labels are readily accessible from Criterion #1. For a visual comparison, Figure 3b and Figure 3c present the Data Maps based on ground truths and pseudo-labels, respectively. Formally, the modified Data Map can be formulated as follows. Let \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\pmb{x}_m\\}_{m=1}^M\\) denote a dataset of \\(M\\) unlabeled images. Considering a minibatch of \\(N\\) images, for each image \\(\\pmb{x}_n\\), its two augmented views form a positive pair, denoted as \\(\\tilde{\\pmb{x}}_i\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\pmb{x}}_j\\).

Visually, hard-to-contrast data gather in the bottom region of the Dataset Maps and “easy-to-contrast” data gather in the top region. As expected, hard-to-learn data are more typical, possessing the most common visual patterns as the entire dataset; whereas easy-to-learn data appear like outliers [54, 26], which may not follow the majority data distribution (examples in Figure 3a and Figure 3c). Additionally, we also plot the original Dataset Map [12, 48] in Figure 3b, which grouped data into hard-to-learn and easy-to-learn. Although the results in §3.2 show equally compelling performance achieved by both easy-to-learn [48] and hard-to-contrast data (ours), the latter do not require any manual annotation, and therefore are more practical and suitable for vision active learning."

Figure 4 presents the quantitative comparison of four map-based querying strategies, wherein easy- or hard-to-learn are selected by the maps based on pseudolabels. Note that easy- or hard-to-learn are enforced with label diversity, due to their class-stratified distributions in the projected 2D space (illustrated in Figure 3). Results suggest that selecting easy-to-learn or hard-to-contrast data contribute to the optimal models. In any case, easy- or hard-to-learn data can not be selected without knowing ground truths, so these querying strategies are not practical for active learning procedure. Selecting hard-to-contrast, on the other hand, is a label-free strategy and yields the highest performance amongst existing active querying strategies (reviewed in Figure 1).

Analytical results indicate that (1) the level of label diversity and (2) the inclusion of hard-to-contrast data are two explicit criteria to determine the annotation importance. To this end, we devise a novel active querying strategy that can enforce label diversity and determine hard-to-contrast data. The results of three medical imaging and two natural imaging datasets show that our initial query not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin. This finding is significant because it is the first few choices that define the efficacy and efficiency of the subsequent learning procedure. We foresee our solution to the cold start problem as a simple, yet strong, baseline to sample the initial query for active learning in image classification."

We perform repeated augmentation on MedMNIST datasets at the level of dataset, also to enlarge augmentation space and improve generalization. [21] proposed repeated augmentation in a growing batch mode to improve generalization and convergence speed by reducing variances. This approach provokes a challenge in computing resources. Recent works [21,50,7] proved that fixed batch mode also boosts generalization and optimization by increasing mutiplicity of augmentations as well as parameter updates and decreasing the number of unique samples per batch, which holds the batch size fixed. Because the original contrastive learning works [13,15] were implemented on ImageNet dataset, we attempt to simulate the quantity of ImageNet per epoch to achieve optimal performances.

For example in OrganAMNIST, VAAL prefers selecting data in the femur-right and platelet class, but largely ignores data in the lung, liver and monocyte classes.

Overall, Figure shows that hard-to-contrast queries have a greater spread within each cluster than easy-to-contrast ones. Both strategies can cover \\(100\\%\\) classes. Nevertheless, we notice that easy-to-contrast selects local outliers in clusters: samples that do not belong to the majority class in a cluster.
