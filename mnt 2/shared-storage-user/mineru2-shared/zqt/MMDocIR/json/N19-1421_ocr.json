Recent work has focused primarily on answering questions given some relevant document or context, and required very little general background. To investigate question answering with prior knowledge, we present COMMONSENSEQA: a challenging new dataset for commonsense question answering. To capture common sense beyond associations, we extract from CONCEPTNET (Speer et al., 2017) multiple target concepts that have the same semantic relation to a single source concept. Crowd-workers are asked to author multiple-choice questions that mention the source concept and discriminate in turn between each of the target concepts. This encourages workers to create questions with complex semantics that often require prior knowledge. We create 12,247 questions through this procedure and demonstrate the difficulty of our task with a large number of strong baselines. Our best baseline is based on BERT-large (Devlin et al., 2018) and obtains \\(56\\%\\) accuracy, well below human performance, which is \\(89\\%\\)."

We propose a method for generating commonsense questions at scale by asking crowd workers to author questions that describe the relation between concepts from CONCEPTNET (Figure 1). A crowd worker observes a source concept ('River' in Figure 1) and three target concepts ('Waterfall', 'Bridge', 'Valley') that are all related by the same CONCEPTNET relation (AtLocation). The worker then authors three questions, one per target concept, such that only that particular target concept is the answer, while the other two distractor concepts are not. This primes the workers to add commonsense knowledge to the question, that separates the target concept from the distractors. Finally, for each question, the worker chooses one additional distractor from CONCEPTNET, and authors another distractor manually. Thus, in total, five candidate answers accompany each question."

Many commonsense representations and inference procedures have been explored (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Kowalski and Sergot, 1986) and large-scale commonsense knowledge-bases have been developed (Lenat, 1995; Speer et al., 2017).

The Story Cloze Test (also referred to as ROC Stories) pits ground-truth endings to stories against implausible false ones (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016). Interpolating these approaches, Situations with Adversarial Generations (SWAG), asks models to choose the correct description of what happens next after an initial event (Zellers et al., 2018b). LM-based techniques achieve very high performance on the Story Cloze Test and SWAG by fine-tuning a pre-trained LM on the target task (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018)."

Annotation artifacts in the Story Cloze Test, for example, allow models to achieve high performance while only looking at the proposed endings and ignoring the stories (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017).

For example, the question \"If you needed a lamp to do your work, where would you put it?\", and the candidate answer \"bedroom\" would become \"[start] If ... ? [sep] bedroom [end)\". The hidden representations over each [end] token are converted to logits by a linear transformation and passed through a softmax to produce final probabilities for the answers.
