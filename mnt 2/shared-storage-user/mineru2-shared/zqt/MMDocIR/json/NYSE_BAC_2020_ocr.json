On the commercial side, we had invested in our CashPro application, which allowed our clients to safely and securely move billions of dollars every day.

Compared with 2015, we have more customers and clients and more transactions—so more work. Yet costs are down and headcount is down. During those six years, we invested about $18 billion in technology initiatives, added 15% more sales teammates, opened 300 financial centers and refurbished 2,000 more. All of these investments were made while costs came down. We continue to apply the practice of operational excellence to enable us to produce strong returns above our cost of capital while investing back into our company and our capabilities.

As discussed in CEO Brian Moynihan's shareholder letter in this report, the goal of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics is to provide investors and other stakeholders a common set of standards by which to evaluate the progress the company is making to address the societal priorities agreed to in the SDGs. The metrics include non-financial disclosures in four categories: people, planet, prosperity and principles of governance."

In December 2020, under the guidance of His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence Cardinal Peter Turkson, Bank of America joined an alliance of business leaders and companies around the world as part of the Vatican's Council for Inclusive Capitalism (VCIC). Comprising companies that collectively have more than 200 million employees from over 163 countries, the VCIC illustrates how capitalism can take the lead in creating economic growth that is fair, responsible, trusted, dynamic and sustainable. The SMI, the VCIC, and similar organizations recognize the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics as an important step toward providing the disclosures needed to measure the progress that private sector capitalism can help deliver in addressing important societal priorities."

With daycare centers closed, Jessica needed care for her children while working from home, so she looked into Bank of America's expanded childcare benefits after hearing about them from her manager. Eligible teammates can take advantage of the bank's expanded back-up care benefits, which include reimbursement of up to $100 a day when securing their own care provider. \"It was super easy to sign up for the childcare benefit, and the reimbursement process is quick,\" explains Jessica. She took advantage of the opportunity to hire someone from her personal network, and was thrilled to be able to help one of the teachers at her daughters' daycare center who had lost income due to the coronavirus-related closures. \"It's good for her and good for us,\" Jessica said. \"The best part is my entire management team has been extremely supportive. The resources and empathy toward working parents make me really proud to work for Bank of America.\""

Although vaccines have been approved for immunization against COVID-19 in certain countries and restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, COVID-19 cases have significantly increased in recent months in the U.S. and many regions of the world compared to earlier levels. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economies have been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery."

Among other measures, the CARES Act established the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides loans to small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments. The original funding for the PPP under the CARES Act was fully allocated by mid-April 2020, with additional funding made available on April 24, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. In December 2020, an additional economic stimulus package was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the Consolidated Appropriations Act), which provides relief to individuals and businesses. This relief included additional funding for the PPP under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act)."

In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act amended the CARES Act by extending the exemption from TDR classification for COVID-19 related modifications from December 31, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency has ended.

For certain of the remaining products and contracts, the transition will be more complex, particularly where there is no industry-wide protocol or similar mechanism. The Corporation is executing transition plans that are intended to be in line with applicable major industry-wide IBOR product cessation and launch milestones recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private market participants and official sector entities convened by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Bank of England Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group, other than the cessation of LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages.

The Corporation's key transition efforts to date include issuances of debt and deposits linked to SOFR and SONIA by the Corporation, facilitating debt issuances linked to ARRs by clients and secondary market liquidity for products linked to ARRs, originating and arranging loans linked to ARRs, including hedging arrangements, executing, trading, market making and clearing ARR-based derivatives, and launching capabilities and services to support the issuance and trading in products indexed to certain ARRs. The Corporation updated its operational models, systems, procedures and internal infrastructure in connection with the transition to ARRs by the central clearing counterparties. In October 2020, the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2020 IBOR Failbacks Protocol, effective January 25, 2021, which provides a mechanism to enable market participants to incorporate failbacks for certain legacy non-cleared derivatives linked to certain IBORs."

Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90 percent for 2020. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual. Assuming continued economic improvement and based on the forward interest rate curve as of January 19, 2021, when we announced quarterly and annual results for the periods ended December 31, 2020, we expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of 2021 as compared to both the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021.

To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices."

During the first quarter of 2020, in accordance with an interim final rule issued by U.S. banking regulators that was finalized on August 26, 2020, the Corporation delayed for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, the Corporation will add back to CET1 capital 100 percent of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25 percent of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over the three-year period."

Under the rule, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation would be permitted to elect one of two approaches to compute their regulatory capital. The first approach is a bank-based capital approach, which requires that firms maintain CET1 capital greater than or equal to 6.5 percent of the entity's RWA as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity's RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity's uncleared swap margin. The second approach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm maintain net capital greater than or equal to 2.0 percent of its uncleared swap margin. The final rule also includes reporting requirements. The impact on the Corporation is not expected to be significant."

These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020.

For more information, see Managing Risk on page 70. Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning."

Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was \\(584 billion and \\)464 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During 2020, we issued $7.3 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date."

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material."

Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 - Derivatives and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk."

Although we have observed property-level improvements in a number of the most impacted sectors, the length of time for recovery has been slower than originally anticipated, which has prompted additional downgrades. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. For example, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities.

These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees.

We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days."

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation."

Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income.

These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends."

Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business.

For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data."

If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit loss. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of excepted credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset."

The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the Corporation's historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default."

The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate."

The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable."

The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns."

This guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a constant effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is payable at the maturity of the loan. The Corporation includes these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for credit losses. Amounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for credit losses."

Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized."

Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards.

A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 135, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events."

Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach 180 days past due prior to modification are charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they are modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are"

Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase in credit card as the Corporation now reserves for the life of these receivables. The increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included $119 million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of HELOCs and $191 million in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles."

Various economic outlooks were also used in the December 31, 2020 estimate for allowance for credit losses that included consensus estimates, multiple downside scenarios which assumed a significantly longer period until economic recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario to reflect the potential for continued improvement in the consensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. unemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be relatively consistent with the level as of December 2020, slightly above 6.5 percent. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product returns to pre-pandemic levels in the early part of 2022. The allowance for credit losses considers the impact of enacted government stimulus, including the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020, and continues to factor in the unprecedented nature of the current health crisis."

The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote."

The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. For the six-months ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation processed an aggregate purchase volume of $339.2 billion. The Corporation's risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation's reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of COVID-19."

On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of \\)583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA's alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC's interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC's claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied BANA's partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC's claims."

The estimate of the Corporation's PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The decreases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2020 and 2019 resulted in increases to the PBO of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate."

The Corporation's investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures."

Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. Of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019, 61 million and 71 million will vest predominantly over three years with most vesting occurring in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. For RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, the awards are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. Additionally, 25 million and 23 million of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019 will vest predominantly over four years with most vesting occurring in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the shares."

The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option."

Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing"

The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data."

The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management's view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed.

In 2012, we adopted the SEC's Notice and Access rule, which allows certain issuers to inform shareholders of the electronic availability of Proxy materials, including the Annual Report, which significantly reduced the number of printed copies we produce and mail to shareholders. Shareholders still receiving printed copies can join our efforts by electing to receive an electronic copy of the Annual Report and Proxy materials. If you have an account maintained in your name at Computershare Investor Services, you may sign up for this service at www.computershare.com/bac. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may elect to receive an electronic copy of the Proxy materials online at www.proxyvote.com, or contact your broker."
