Throughout 2020, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have made informed decisions with the guidance from health ministries in most of the countries in which we operate, as well as the World Health Organization. As safety, hygiene and customers' trust and confidence in our restaurants is critical in this environment, the Company has established even greater discipline in restaurant operations to meet those needs. McDonald's engaged Mayo Clinic, a global leader in serious and complex healthcare, to provide ongoing counsel and expertise on emerging science in infection prevention and control, and to identify best practices to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Over the last year, elevated standards informed by this engagement have been executed in the majority of McDonald's over 39,000 restaurants, including more than 50 process changes in U.S. restaurants. Encompassed in a framework called Safety+, this effort builds on the Company's history of safety-first leadership in McDonald's restaurants, and supplements the work of global markets to help keep customers and crew safe."

We have shared this policy and training with our franchisees and encourage them to utilize these tools and resources. We also recognize how important it is to provide channels for employees to report human rights concerns. Company employees can raise concerns in many ways, including through an anonymous global channel, the Business Integrity Line – staffed by a live operator from an independent company – 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is complemented by additional reporting channels in many markets.

The increase was primarily due to the Company's strategic acquisitions of a real estate entity, Dynamic Yield and Apprente, partly offset by lower capital expenditures."

The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by \\(10\\%\\) in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2020 levels nor a \\(10\\%\\) adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2020 levels would materially affect the Company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments."

Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations that can affect our business plans and operations, and have increased our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings."

The Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing network."

The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a methodology that instead reflects a current estimate of all expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables. The guidance requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses at the time the asset is recorded, while considering a broader range of information to estimate credit losses including country specific macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends and aging behavior of receivables, among others. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company had an Allowance for bad debts of $55.3 million as of December 31, 2020 recorded as a reduction to Accounts and notes receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet."

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. In the current period, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of impairment. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of \\(14.5 million and \\)113.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively."

Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Company's stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares."

For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management&#x27;s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled.</td></tr><tr><td>Auditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and legal rulings and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm&#x27;s-length transaction).</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit</td><td>We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#x27;s process to assess the technical merits and measure unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions. For example, we tested management&#x27;s review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management&#x27;s transfer pricing studies, and the assessment of other third-party information.</td></tr><tr><td>With the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merits of the Company&#x27;s position and testing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the transfer pricing studies executed by management, and compared the methods used to alternative methods and industry benchmarks. We also reviewed the Company&#x27;s communications with the relevant tax authorities and any advice obtained by the Company from third-party advisors. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity, income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the positions and the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing.</td></tr></table>"

The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with Section 409A. Any payments that qualify for the \"short-term deferral\" exception, the separation pay exception or another exception under Section 409A shall be paid under the applicable exception. For purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment or installment in a series of payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a \"separation from service\" under Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of penalty taxes on you pursuant to Section 409A. In no event may you, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement, and to the extent required by Section 409A, any payment that may be paid in more than one taxable year (depending on the time that you execute this Agreement) shall be paid in the later taxable year. In no event shall McDonald's be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on you by Section 409A or otherwise or for damages for failing to comply with Section 409A. If McDonald's, on the advice of counsel, reasonably believes that this Agreement, or any benefit hereunder, is subject to and does not comply with the requirements of Section 409A, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to take such steps as are reasonably necessary and appropriate, including amending this Agreement, to avoid the imposition of a Section 409A penalty while maintaining to the maximum extent possible, the economic benefits provided to you in this Agreement. If you are deemed on your Termination Date to be a \"specified employee\" within the meaning of Section 409A, then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered \"nonqualified deferred compensation\" under Section 409A payable on account of a \"separation from service,\" to the extent required by Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall be made or provided on the date which is the earlier of (a) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of your \"separation from service,\" and (b) the date of your death, to the extent required under Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this section shall be paid or reimbursed to you in a lump sum and all remaining payments and benefits due (if any) shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment"

The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter's investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2020 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2020 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2019 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2020 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2019 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average."
