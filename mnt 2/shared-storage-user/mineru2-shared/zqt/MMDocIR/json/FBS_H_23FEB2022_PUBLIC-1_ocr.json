Reporting directly to the Secretary of State, H advances the Secretary's objectives with the Legislative Branch by maintaining relationships and regular interactions with Members of Congress while leading the Department's mission-critical efforts to confirm Executive Branch nominees and ensure the Department's proper resourcing to carry out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The high-profile, fast-paced, and essential nature of H's duties mandates stringent controls and a high degree of discretion and care in all H operations. H is also the first, and sometimes the only, point of contact for Members of Congress and their staffs who interact with State. For this reason, H strives to put its best foot forward by maintaining a customer-focused, objective, hospitable, and results-oriented approach to congressional engagement. Our interactions are informed by a spirit of collegiality, integrity, and commitment to public service, and as a bureau, we are proud to advance United States foreign policy on behalf of the American people."

The Constitution's division of responsibilities for foreign affairs invariably makes the role of H a mission critical necessity. Article I and Article II make clear that the executive and legislative branch each have a role in the conduct of foreign policy, but the duties enumerated are simultaneously too vague and too narrow to fully delineate just how those respective roles should operate in practice. The result is often a struggle between the two branches over the privilege of directing American foreign policy. H operates in the interstice of this struggle between the executive and legislative efforts to design, implement, and oversee foreign affairs."

In order to meet new and ongoing needs, the Bureau must strengthen information systems. To date, we have followed through on management reforms by upgrading our use of electronic means to distribute reports, track and clear correspondence and track other information; increased our reliance on our House and Senate Liaison Offices to keep abreast of emerging Congressional issues; and continued to pursue consolidation and simplification of Congressionally mandated reports and improve our support for Congressional travel. It is critically important that we continue advancing our management reform efforts. That means continuing to reduce our processing times on Hill correspondence and continuing to streamline our congressionally mandated reporting requirements. H has worked diligently to provide a Distance Learning Course on support for CODELS. If our staff at overseas posts do not avail themselves of training, H risks missing strategic opportunities to promote legislative initiatives and key issues if CODELS and STAFFDELS are not effectively managed."
