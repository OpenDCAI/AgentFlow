The diversity of Sub-Saharan Africa is evident not only in the economic realm, with wide variance in per capita income and financial sector development across its 49 countries, but also across the spectrum of political stability, from well-established democratic governments to fragile and volatile regimes that struggle to provide basic services and security, as evidenced by the concerning number of coups and other extra-constitutional changes in government over the last year. While noteworthy centers of business, technology, and innovation exist across the continent with significant interest and investment from global institutional and strategic investors, the pandemic has had profound impacts on political and economic prospects, as well as on the well-being of Africans. Further, climate change and its impact on regulatory and investment patterns has emerged as a significant challenge, both locally and internationally, with the potential to slow much-needed drivers of change and growth. These variations and differences significantly influence diplomatic engagement, regional integration, and the delivery of development assistance."

The sheer diversity across the continent means that the people of Africa experience insecurity differently based on many factors, including where they live, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity, religion, class, occupation, and other intersecting identities. Yet the continent has enormous potential and Africa's rich marketplace of ideas hold the promise to unlock the human potential and agency of all its people. We acknowledge our historic ties with Sub-Saharan Africa and renew our commitment to advancing peace and security as equal partners in a prosperous future that is built back better. To accomplish this, we must address challenges in security, stability, and democracy by first identifying root causes of violence and building resiliency from the ground up."

The sub-objectives supporting this objective prioritize funding and programs to assist African partners to solidify the legal foundations of law-and-order institutions; support women, peace, and security (WPS) goals; further professionalize security service delivery; and provide technical skills that enable mission execution. Professional and cultural exchanges, including youth programs, the U.S. Speaker Program, Sports Diplomacy, the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), and American Spaces provide opportunities to share U.S. expertise in areas such as countering violent extremism, respecting human rights, promoting good governance, and strengthening the rule of law."

Power Africa will continue to work in partnership with African governments and private sector, multilateral, and donor partners to increase investment in and access to reliable, affordable power—an essential input to increase the competitiveness of African products in international markets. These efforts, combined with Feed the Future activities to improve agricultural productivity, domestic market linkages, and women's empowerment in agriculture, food security, and nutrition are critical components of our efforts to accelerate broad-based economic growth and reduce poverty. We will enhance and elevate the economic empowerment of women and girls, in all their diversity, within and across all initiatives, recognizing that women and girls, LGBTQI+ people, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, and other systemically marginalized populations are overrepresented among Africa's economically poorest people.

Most African countries have fast-growing youth populations, burgeoning middle classes with appetites for high-quality American goods, and increasing regional integration that creates ever-larger markets. Many U.S. businesses, particularly those in the energy, medical, agricultural, technology and service sectors, are highly competitive in Africa. Despite the strong economic opportunities, a core set of constraints limits U.S. trade and investment flows to Africa, as well as those from Africa to the United States. For instance, U.S. firms are constrained in entering or expanding in African markets due to a lack of familiarity with African markets and the difficulty in accessing timely, accurate, and reliable market information or intelligence on specific firms or opportunities. African businesses also face challenges trading and investing in the United States, resulting from U.S. perceptions of African business capacity, risk, and a lack of information on U.S. consumer expectations and the regulations on product quality. Access to the financing and equipment required to meet U.S. commercial needs for volume or timeliness of supply is also a key constraint. Meeting these U.S. market demands requires access to expertise, new technologies, and financing. African publics also need to be better informed of the scope of our existing trade relationships and desire to expand them in an effort to counter the perception that China is more willing to do business with Africa."

These largely exogenous risks were considered by the interagency and reflected in the design of initiatives such as Prosper Africa and the USAID Africa Trade and Investment Activity, which target both country-level and transaction-level constraints. This dual focus is itself a risk mitigation strategy. For example, these interagency initiatives provide support across sectors and regions, allowing for more flexibility to respond to changes in macroeconomic conditions and generating tangible benefits for individual businesses regardless of country-level developments beyond our control. However, we will also work to address macro-level constraints through partnerships and technical support, for example to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) and other regional economic bodies."

Though longstanding development and security challenges will continue to complicate growth, rapid urbanization combined with economic integration efforts such as AfCFTA will make Africa's expanding market more accessible and attractive to U.S. businesses. Stronger economic governance and regional integration create larger markets that improve economies of scale; reduce transaction costs for local, regional, and global trade; and make large-scale infrastructure projects more attractive to investors. We will engage with regional economic communities, national governments, the AU, other multilateral entities, and international financial institutions to promote regional integration and reduce barriers to trade and investment flows across the continent. We will continue to promote specific efforts in African countries to reduce the time and cost to trade in areas, including addressing technical barriers to trade and improving the infrastructure related to trade facilitation such as transport infrastructure, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and testing facilities. We will also encourage and provide opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa's increasingly influential private sector, as well as the U.S. private sector, to engage governments and encourage the adoption of necessary reforms."

Addressing issues of political and social exclusion and inequalities, human rights violations and abuses, endemic corruption, and improving public service delivery can counter democratic backsliding. These efforts also provide the greatest opportunity to ensure the human dignity of all persons in Sub-Saharan Africa is respected through positive health outcomes, equitable access to education, freedom from discrimination and violence, social resiliency, economic opportunity, and equitable access to justice."

We will continue to elevate women's substantive participation in democratic processes and institutions and support policies designed to increase the percentage of women holding elected and appointed offices at regional, national, and local levels. Fundamental to improving women's meaningful political participation is removing systemic, institutional, and cultural barriers, including gender-based violence against women in politics. We will also encourage increased participation of other marginalized communities, including but not limited to LGBTQI+ persons, ethnic and racial minorities, Indigenous Peoples, refugees and displaced persons, and persons with disabilities.

We will work to prevent human rights abuses and atrocities and support transitional justice processes, with a particular focus on restorative justice mechanisms and longer-term reconciliation.

This Strategy will support capacity building for key actors and civil society, training for national and subnational elections commissions, promotion of diverse representation in government, and voter education and election observation programs. We will also encourage policies or laws to increase the political participation of marginalized groups (including women and youth) as voters, civil society members and leaders, and office holders at all levels of government. In relatively well performing states, we will advocate for and support continued consolidation of democratic institutions; these countries can be influential, including via the regional economic communities, in efforts to expand and strengthen democratization in neighboring states, thereby improving the democratic profile of Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we will increasingly integrate understanding of the benefits and risks of technological innovations into our activities to enable democratic progress by leveraging mobile technologies, social networks, and youth and women's engagement."

Sustainable capacity in these areas is critical to help countries in the region accelerate inclusive growth and mitigate climate change. Fragile states, weak institutions, poor economic governance, the unsustainable management of natural resources, gender and other social inequalities, and income disparity continue to hinder development."

GHSA brings the United States, country stakeholders, and international partners together to protect populations from epidemics and threats they pose to human life, the global economy, and our national security. USAID's expertise in disaster response also contributes to establishment of emergency operations centers, critical to real-time outbreak response. Our PEPFAR programs strive to make strategic, scientifically sound investments to rapidly scale-up core HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions, and maximize impact. As more and more countries achieve HIV epidemic control, health systems will need to absorb many of the responsibilities previously held by outside organizations. We support efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality by implementing cost-effective and evidence-based interventions to address otherwise-preventable deaths, train health personnel, improve the recognition of danger signs, and the importance of seeking care. We promote the appropriate use of community health workers to support a wide range of child and family health interventions and improved, including care for small and sick newborns. We promote child marriage-sensitive programming that aims to meet the health-related needs of girls vulnerable to child marriage and its health consequences. Our family planning assistance will continue to help women and couples in Africa choose the number, timing, and spacing of their pregnancies, resulting in significant social, economic, and health gains for families and communities."

This includes recognizing the direct and indirect impacts of the climate crisis on women, girls, and marginalized communities, and empowering these communities as leaders and innovators in overcoming local climate challenges. Climate change is not gender neutral, as women and girls, and men and boys, experience the effects of climate change differently. These effects and shocks tend to exacerbate and are exacerbated by underlying gender and other systemic social inequalities and vulnerabilities, including gender-based violence."

Through the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE), we will provide funds to finance climate adaptation projects that will reduce the impact of climate change on those most endangered by it. As part of that plan, we will support the Africa Adaptation Initiative and its accelerator program, which aims to plan and finance infrastructure that is energy-efficient and resilient to climate change. We will continue to work with the African Union and other regional partners on climate-smart investments in agriculture, protecting forests, and improving climate education. Ventures supported by Power Africa and the Development Finance Corporation will contribute to the expansion of renewable energy and foster the industries and infrastructure of a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. The objectives, milestones, and indicators below outline a comprehensive effort to effectively limit the risk of climate change to communities and countries where we work by improving climate adaptation and preparedness, strengthening climate policy and ambition across sectors, moving towards net zero emission development, and mobilizing the finance necessary to achieve climate goals across all sectors."

The revised Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) of 2021 integrates food and nutrition security strategies with approaches that incorporate resilience capacity building, integrated climate adaptation and natural resource management, women's empowerment and gender equality, and inclusive agriculture-led economic growth that contributes to sustainable transformation of African agriculture and food systems. GFSS is implemented through the FTF initiative, through which the United States partners with targeted African countries to generate broad-based economic growth and improved food security and nutrition. This U.S. strategy will advance global stability and prosperity by improving the most basic of human conditions—the need that families and individuals have for a reliable source of quality food and sufficient resources to purchase it. FTF addresses the root causes of poverty and hunger. By catalyzing responsible private sector investment and promoting higher levels of public investment and assistance for agriculture and food security, U.S. food security and nutrition efforts connect farmers to markets, increase farmers' productivity and resilience, and enable them to better manage risks, withstand shocks, and in some cases make the transition from receiving humanitarian assistance to engaging in more self-reliant economic development. Since FTF was launched in 2010, our investments in food and nutrition security have reduced poverty and child stunting—the best surrogate indicator for nutritional status—and helped vulnerable populations become more resilient to food crises."

We also remain committed to gender equity and quality, recognizing that young women and adolescent girls have different needs and face different barriers than young men, and have decreased opportunities due to systemic gender inequalities. We will support equitable access to the tools, education, and opportunities required by the increase in technology use and dependency that is rising across the region. By improving critical thinking skills, effective communication, freedom of thought and expression, and inclusive and sustainable economic growth opportunities, young women and young men are better placed to be leaders of their own development and help to build more stable and prosperous societies."

The rapidly growing youth population, rise of violent extremism, and high youth unemployment underscore the urgency to invest in youth worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts youth through adverse effects such as loss of education; increased unemployment; increased rates of adolescent pregnancy, and of child, early, and forced marriage and other forms of gender-based violence; and deterioration of mental well-being. The negative impacts are particularly acute for young women, youth with disabilities, young LGBTQI+ persons, and young people within marginalized populations."

Girls also tend to return to school at lower rates than boys once schools reopen. Youth unemployment is nearly triple the general population rate, and lack of engagement has left youth susceptible to sexual exploitation and abuse, harmful labor, illicit activity, or extremist groups. This objective also considers several potential risks, including sufficient political will and effective domestic resource mobilization, the ability to recruit and retain essential staff at all levels, public norms that value education and completion, and the quality and relevance of education and training provided."
