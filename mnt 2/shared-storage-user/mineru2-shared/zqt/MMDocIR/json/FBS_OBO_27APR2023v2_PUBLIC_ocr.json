The Department operates in unpredictable environments and is facing rapidly changing security risks, political and civil unrest, global pandemics, and evolving natural hazards threats exacerbated by climate change. Physical attacks conducted by adversaries against U.S. embassies, consulates, and facilities abroad continue to threaten our people and properties. The Department's unique worldwide presence requires the ability to respond to rapidly changing situations and evolving threats in real time. To be effective in the years ahead, OBO must modernize its program to optimize performance and continuously improve critical project delivery drivers. The Bureau must also improve its ability to assess the exposure and vulnerability of the global portfolio to natural hazards and adapt to corresponding risks while at the same time leveraging multi-attribute decision analysis tools to improve occupant safety, security, and well-being, as well as overall staff satisfaction with residential facilities overseas."
