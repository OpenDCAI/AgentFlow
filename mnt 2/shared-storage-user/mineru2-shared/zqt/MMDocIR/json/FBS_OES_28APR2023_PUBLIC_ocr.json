We will raise political will, mobilize resources, and strengthen operational capacity to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and nature crime — individually and at their convergence — including wildlife and timber trafficking, and criminal forms of mining, fishing, and land conversion. We will encourage partner countries to establish new protected areas, including marine protected areas, and improve the effectiveness of existing protected areas to generate global benefits for biodiversity and carbon storage. We will support countries in building health security capacities that bridge human and animal health, leveraging a One Health approach to prevent, rapidly detect, and respond to zoonotic disease spillover, while promoting the maintenance of biodiversity as key to discovery of new medicines. We will encourage the use of nature-based solutions, develop new financing mechanisms, including leveraging philanthropic and corporate funding. This objective supports JSP objective 2.2."

OES is well placed to lead on this effort, given the bureau’s leadership role in multilateral fora. OES will mitigate the risk of global apathy to take action to address nature conservation through robust public diplomacy and by working with likeminded partners, including indigenous and local communities, and non-traditional biodiversity stakeholders (e.g., in health) to hold governments accountable for their commitments and by leveraging private sector action and financing to incentivize conservation efforts."

We will lead U.S. negotiations on a new global instrument to reduce and ultimately eliminate plastic pollution. Exhaustible natural resources such as fish stocks and other living marine resources require careful management to remain sustainable. We will advocate for more proactive tools to manage shared fisheries and protect marine ecosystems from the impacts of fishing.

We will strengthen partnerships with likeminded allies to promote research integrity and shape the standards that ensure quality, protect consumer health and safety, facilitate trade, conserve the environment, and promote democratic values. A global technology revolution is underway, with leading powers racing to develop and deploy new and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing that will shape our lives and the 21st-century global economy. These same nations see the value of space technology and applications to drive their economies and create new industries and jobs. OES leadership will help ensure the technological and digital transformations serve our people and pave the way for new trade, investment, and research opportunities for U.S. companies and academic institutions.

Robust global health systems that fight threats posed by infectious and non-infectious disease are central to international peace, security, and prosperity - and human well-being. Environmental challenges such as rapidly escalating levels of plastics and other pollution, loss of biodiversity, and rising temperatures threaten global peace, security, and prosperity. These issues also fundamentally drive and shape America's interests and influence globally. And this work is urgent — if we fail to address these challenges, the consequences for people, nature, and the planet will be dire and irreversible. OES will work with U.S. partners and allies, and through international and multilateral institutions, to mitigate these global threats and protect the American people. Our unmatched web of alliances and partnerships are our greatest force multiplier in maintaining a stable, open, rules-based international system. Our alliances and partnerships enhance our ability to deter and disrupt threats before they reach our shores and to counter and compete with our adversaries. The world is looking to the United States for leadership at this critical moment and we must deliver to build the economic, health, and environmental architecture on which our people and planet will rely for years to come."

Given more than 85 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) driving the planet's warming come from beyond our borders, OES will support urgent and transformative international actions that secure new or improved commitments on emissions reductions, strengthen the resilience of populations vulnerable to climate variability and change that is already occurring, and improve capacity to transparently report climate actions.

OES will work to improve water security, establish recognized boundaries and limits for maritime space, to promote rule of law, and encourage cooperation to resolve conflicts and reduce tensions over natural resources in accordance with international law and instruments. Similarly, increased orbital debris and expanded use by an ever-growing number of countries threaten the peaceful use of outer space. The U.S. private sector is revolutionizing the use of outer space with new technologies and business models for space tourism, asteroid mining, space launch vehicles, new satellite applications, and other commercial endeavors. OES will lead U.S. government efforts to develop voluntary international standards and guidelines that ensure the long-term sustainability of space operations and enable U.S. companies to responsibly launch innovative space ventures. This objective supports JSP objectives 2.2 and 2.3."

Our funding mechanisms for our international agreements are also critical for success and we will work to increase their transparency and effectiveness. Together with like-minded partners and allies, we are better able to keep pace (often outpace) our competitors and disrupt the ability of malign actors to undermine our interests. This includes championing transparency and accountability, promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and shaping the rules and norms of the international order."

In some situations, embassies can utilize technical expertise from other U.S. government agencies and U.S. citizens. OES manages two programs – the Embassy Science Fellows and the U.S. Science Envoys – which leverage United States talent in the conduct of diplomacy. The Embassy Science Fellows program matches U.S. government employees from the science inter-agency with U.S. Posts abroad to advance U.S. policy goals. The U.S. Science Envoys program identifies eminent private American scientists or executives to meet foreign counterparts and public audiences to advance U.S. objectives. Both programs have a strong track record of addressing key foreign policy issues, such as health security and the climate crisis. This objective supports JSP objectives 2.3, 2.4, and 4.1."
