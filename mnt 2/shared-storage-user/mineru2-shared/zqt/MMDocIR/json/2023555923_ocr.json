New legislation on lobbying activities is aligned with efforts of the Czech government to fight corruption; however, it is criticized for creating numerous loopholes. A publicly available registry of lobbyists will be established. Czech and foreign nationals can register as lobbyists. Reporting of the lobbying interests and purposes will be required. In absence of enforceable legislation, present lobbying activities are regulated by voluntary measures and general limitations on bribery and other prohibited activities established under criminal and administrative law. Registration of foreign agents is not required under Czech law. Foreign investors in sensitive areas are subjects to a special screening mechanism and government oversight. While no information on parliamentary discussions concerning Chinese policies in Czechia during the lobbying law debates has been located, Chinese influence and involvement in Czech economic and social life appears to be a matter of concern for scholars and counterintelligence services."

The Sapin II Law not only consolidated both the Assembly's and Senate's then existing registers,[28] but also expanded the new register's coverage to include lobbying efforts aimed at the executive branch.[29] Furthermore, as noted above, the 2022 law extended the list of public players covered by the lobbyist register, covering public decision-makers acting at the local level, and in particular, local executives. Under Sapin II, public and private entities, including chambers of commerce and industry, must register if at least one executive, employee, or member regularly engages in activities that influence government decisions.[30]"

The law also incorporates rules regarding the rights and obligations of interest representatives and requires these and governmental bodies that communicate with them to file annual statements with the National Transparent Authority regarding the communication. It does not appear that any concerns regarding China or Chinese entities were raised or debated in the legislative process that led to the adoption of Law 4829/2021.

Despite this ranking, the Netherlands has been criticized for not improving the transparency, integrity, and equality of access with regard to lobbying. The European Commission, in its annual Rule of Law Report, noted that the Netherlands has made progress on a new code of conduct for ministers and state secretaries, but criticized that no independent oversight and sanctioning mechanism was included. Furthermore, the report stated that “[s]ome progress has been made on revised rules on revolving doors . . . , while the mechanism’s reliance on . . . non-binding advice might limit its effectiveness.”"

Passes are issued to employees of public affairs and public relations agencies; representatives of civil society organizations, trade associations, or umbrella organizations; and representatives of municipalities and provinces.[8] A list of currently registered lobbyists is available on the website of the House of Representatives.[9] The list includes the names of the lobbyists, the name of their workplace, and whose interests they are promoting."
