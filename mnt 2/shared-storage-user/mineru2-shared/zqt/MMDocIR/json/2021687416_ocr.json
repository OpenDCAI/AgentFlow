In 31 out of the 36 jurisdictions surveyed, laws were found that afford journalists protection (to varied extent) from compelled disclosure of their sources. The report focuses on the definition of a protected journalist, the content that is considered protected information, the limits placed on the authorities' powers to compel journalists to disclose information, and the procedures for disclosure. The report covers all OECD countries except the United States and Israel, and includes detailed survey reports for 12 jurisdictions selected among these, namely, Canada, Chile, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, and Turkey. Information pertaining to the rest of the surveyed OECD jurisdictions is compiled in the annexed table, wherein citations to the relevant laws are provided."

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is the international court of the Council of Europe (CoE) and the body that is tasked with the interpretation of the ECHR, ruled in the landmark 1997 case of Goodwin v. United Kingdom and its progeny cases that article 10 of the ECHR enshrining the right to freedom of expression requires contracting states to introduce effective legal procedural safeguards for the disclosure of journalistic sources compelled by judicial or law enforcement authorities. These include, at a minimum, the possibility of review of the decision compelling disclosure by an independent and impartial body whose review would be governed by clear criteria. That entity would consider whether less intrusive measures would be sufficient to address the public interest that is invoked by the authorities. The reasoning provided by the ECtHR in this line of cases is that the protection of journalistic sources is crucial for the press to perform its \"public watchdog\" role in democratic societies."

In Turkey, it appears that telecommunications between suspects in criminal proceedings and protected persons under that country's shield law cannot be intercepted under a court order if those communications might reveal a news source."

                "content": "Concerning rules exempting journalists from giving testimony that might reveal their sources, the surveyed jurisdictions have adopted diverse approaches. In many jurisdictions, such as Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Mexico City, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Turkey, there exist legal provisions that explicitly exempt journalists or authors of journalistic content from providing testimony in court regarding journalistic information or sources. In most of these jurisdictions, however, exceptions to these exemptions exist, such as in Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Sweden, where the protected person may be compelled to testify in cases concerning serious crimes that are enumerated in the law, or exceed a penalty threshold. In Germany, however, this exception only relates to the content of materials that members of the press have produced themselves or to notes or professional observations, and it only applies if it does not reveal the identity of the informant or the content of the information communicated. In some jurisdictions, such as in Italy, New Zealand, and Norway, courts may override the presumptive exemptions granted to protected persons under certain circumstances where the withheld information is crucial for the case. In a number of the jurisdictions, general procedural rules regarding the protection of professional secrecy appear to protect journalists from being compelled to provide testimony that might reveal their sources."

The law amends Canada's Evidence Act to allow journalists to object to the disclosure of information or of a document that identifies or is likely to identify a source, unless a court authorizes it because the information or document cannot be obtained by any other reasonable means and the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the public interest in preserving the source's identity. The law also amends the Criminal Code to protect journalists and media outlets targeted by a warrant or order and entitles journalists to apply for an order that documents not be disclosed to law enforcement while setting forth the conditions under which a disclosure may be made. According to the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Canada, this shield law establishes threshold requirements in the statutory scheme, including that the person objecting to the disclosure of information or a document because it could disclose a source's identity must show that he or she is a \"journalist\" and that the source is a \"journalistic source\" as defined under the law."

Journalists have the right to refuse to divulge their sources or to be pressured to divulge their sources. Journalists summoned before an investigating judge or a criminal court to be heard as witnesses on information gathered in the course of their work are free not to reveal the origin of the information, but they are nevertheless required to appear. Under penalty of nullity of the proceedings, information obtained by judicial requisition in violation of the protection of confidentiality of sources may not part of a criminal case. Courts may only infringe the confidentiality of sources if there is an overriding public interest in doing so and if the measures considered are strictly necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. French law has been criticized for not providing enough protection for journalists' sources."

These provisions have been in existence for decades, and they have been the subject of important case law by the Italian Supreme Court. Italy's highest court has held that the protection of a journalist's right not to disclose sources extends to any information that could help to identify a source of confidential information. Under Italian law, it appears that only under the following circumstances may a journalist's privilege of non-disclosures of sources be exempted: (a) upon the uncertain authenticity of the news; (b) the indispensability of the news for the evidence of a crime; and (c) upon the impossibility to verify the authenticity of the information with instruments other than the identification of its source. The limitations on a judicial order compelling disclosure of sources is not completely clear in the Italian legal order, as courts interpret the applicable provisions on a case-by-case basis. What is clear, however, is that individual freedoms and rights established by the Italian Constitution prevail over any other rights and privileges established in ordinary legislation."

Disclosure of sources may be ordered by a court only following a petition by law enforcement authorities. While the law does not provide for a definitive list of circumstances when a disclosure of sources can be compelled, it requires the judge to balance between the public interest and the rights of the person. A court decision can be appealed. No reports of serious violations of the right of journalists to protect their sources were located."

These procedural safeguards must include, at a minimum, the possibility of review of the decision compelling disclosure by an independent and impartial body whose review would be governed by clear criteria and would consider whether less intrusive measures would be sufficient to address the public interest invoked by the authorities.[8]"

The class of protected persons (and the scope of protection) partly depends on the meaning of the term “news” as it appears in article 12. The term “news” is not defined in the text of the law. However, within the context of the constitutional right to freedom of the press, the Court of Cassation has described the role of the news as “presenting to the public opinion the thoughts and actions of those running public affairs … and notifying the public of information and ideas related to political developments and other areas of public interest that are relevant to public debate.”[13] The fact that the protection was granted in the Press Law, which applies to all publications, and not the Press Labor Law, where “journalist” as a professional status is defined, supports the conclusion that the protected class of “authors” includes those outside of the Press Labor Law’s definition for “journalist,” thus including freelance writers or individual bloggers engaged in the communication of “news.”[14] The Court of Cassation has not had occasion to address this issue, however."

The provision does not include journalists or the protected parties under article 12 of the Press Law in the class of relevant professionals. The explanatory memorandum of the bill that beacme the CPC justified excluding \"journalists\" from the protected class under article 46 on the basis that in comparative law, journalists' communications are not generally considered to be covered by professional secrecy rules (unlike the communications of attorneys, health professionals, or members of religious institutions in counseling roles).[20]"
