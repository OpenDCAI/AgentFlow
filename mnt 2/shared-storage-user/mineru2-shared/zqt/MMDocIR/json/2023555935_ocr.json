The new building will replace the current facility that is past its lifecycle, and will be rebuilt within the existing site footprint. The CBSA will use building and construction methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contribute to sustainable development commitments by integrating climate change resilience into the design, construction, and operational aspects of the project and by reducing the environmental impact of structural construction materials using recycled and lower-carbon materials. Temporary facilities have been installed in order to keep the port of entry operational during construction. This project will consist of multiple phases. First, the project will demolish any required outbuildings. This will be followed by site preparations for the new facility, and then finally the construction of the new facility along with new roadways. Once commissioned and deemed operational, the staff will move into the new facility. The old Port of Entry will be demolished and any site works corrected to bring the new facility to operational efficiency.[19]"

Current agreements with Argentina aim for integrated and joint management and administration of the common land border between the two countries concerning customs, immigration, health, and transportation matters, and they encompass the exit and entry of private vehicles, passenger transport, and merchandise between their territories. Chile also has signed a treaty with Bolivia providing for the integrated management of land ports of entry between the two countries.

These crossing points are not open daily and allow border crossing during a limited number of hours. While authorities conduct regular border control procedures at these points, crossing at such points is allowed for local citizens of the two neighboring countries without being counted as a trip abroad and without stamping their passport.[6] These bilateral crossing points were established shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on borders between Russia and other former Soviet republics."

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the former internal boundaries that demarcated territory between the Russian Federation and other former Soviet republics, which had been of minimal administrative significance, became external state borders.[7] In 2007, in order to build and maintain new borders, a new federal cabinet-level institution, the State Border Maintenance Agency, was created. This agency coordinated all activities in the field of border construction, including LPOEs.[8] It was involved in drafting, construction, remodeling, equipment supply, IT, and telecommunications support of border infrastructure, as well as administration of border, customs, and other types of control. The agency was required to apply a so-called differentiated approach toward border maintenance, considering regional specifics and security needs.[9] The agency was closed in 2016, and some of its functions were transferred to a federal state enterprise, the Directorate for Construction and Operation of Border Facilities (Rosgranstroi), which is subordinated to the Transportation Ministry.[10]"

The UK is connected to France by the channel tunnel and introduced juxtaposed border controls at this border, whereby immigration controls are conducted in France for those entering the UK and vice versa for those leaving the UK to go to France. Responsibility for the port is established under a variety of bilateral agreements, and the UK and France have both contributed significant sums to improve the security of the port. Since the UK left the European Union, it introduced a number of temporary inland border facilities to enable customs checks and controls on trucks bringing goods into the UK to be conducted away from ports that did not have the necessary infrastructure."
