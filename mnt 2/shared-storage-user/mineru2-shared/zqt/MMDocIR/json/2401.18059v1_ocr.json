However, most existing methods retrieve only short contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, limiting holistic understanding of the overall document context. We introduce the novel approach of recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text, constructing a tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up. At inference time, our RAPTOR model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across lengthy documents at different levels of abstraction. Controlled experiments show that retrieval with recursive summaries offers significant improvements over traditional retrieval-augmented LMs on several tasks. On question-answering tasks that involve complex, multi-step reasoning, we show state-of-the-art results; for example, by coupling RAPTOR retrieval with the use of GPT-4, we can improve the best performance on the QuALITY benchmark by \\(20\\%\\) in absolute accuracy."

With the growing size of LLMs, they can serve standalone as very effective knowledge stores, with facts encoded within their parameters (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Talmor et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023; Kandpal et al., 2023) and models can be further improved with fine-tuning on downstream tasks (Roberts et al., 2020). Nevertheless, even a large model does not contain sufficient domain-specific knowledge for particular tasks and the world continues to change, invalidating facts in the LLM. Updating the knowledge of these models through additional fine-tuning or editing is difficult, particularly when dealing with vast text corpora (Lewis et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2022). An alternative approach, pioneered in open domain question answering systems (Chen et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018), is to index large quantities of text, after splitting it into chunks (paragraphs), in a separate information retrieval system. Retrieved information is then presented to the LLM along with the question as context (\"retrieval augmentation\", Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Min et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023), making it easy to provide a system with current knowledge particular to some domain and enabling easy interpretability and provenance tracking, whereas the parametric knowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source (Akyurek et al., 2022)."

Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have indeed expanded the context lengths that models can handle, leading to questions about the need for retrieval systems (Dai et al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al. (2021) have noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as context length increases, especially when pertinent information is embedded within a lengthy context. Moreover, practically, use of long contexts is expensive and slow. This suggests that selecting the most relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial."

Retrieval methods have transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like TF-IDF (Sparck Jones, 1972) and BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2020) to deep learning-based strategies (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Sachan et al., 2023). Some recent work proposes using large language models as retrievers due to their ability to memorize extensive knowledge (Yu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022). Research on the reader component includes Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) (Izacard & Grave, 2022), which employs both DPR and BM25 for retrieval and processes passages independently in the encoder and RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), which utilizes cross-chunked attention and chunkwise retrieval to generate text grounded on retrieved context."

The summarization/snippet model by Gao et al. (2023) uses summarizations and snippets of passages, which improves correctness on most datasets but can sometimes be a lossy means of compression. The recursive-abstractive summarization model by Wu et al. (2021) employs task decomposition to summarize smaller text chunks, which are later integrated to form summaries of larger sections. While this method is effective for capturing broader themes, it can miss granular details. LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022) mitigates this issue by similarly summarizing adjacent text chunks but also retaining intermediate nodes thus storing varying levels of detail, keeping granular details. However, both methods, due to their reliance on adjacency for grouping or summarizing adjacent nodes, may still overlook distant interdependencies within the text, which we can find and group with RAPTOR."

For example, we exclusively retrieve from the leaf nodes and each upper layer, as well as from different contiguous subsets of the layers.

By employing recursive clustering and summarization techniques, RAPTOR creates a hierarchical tree structure that is capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the retrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective retrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks."
