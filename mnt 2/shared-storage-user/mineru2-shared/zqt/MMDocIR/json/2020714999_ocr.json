In Ukraine, the pandemic coincided with ongoing public debates concerning legislative initiatives related to media and fake news. No provision in Indian or Belarusian law specifically deals with \"fake news.\" However, as described in the report on India, a \"number of offenses under various laws criminalize certain forms of speech that may constitute 'fake news' and have been applied to cases involving the spread of false news regarding COVID-19.\" Similarly, in Belarus, dispersing false information is prosecuted under a Criminal Code article, which punishes the \"discrediting\" of the Republic of Belarus or its government authorities. In view of the absence of special provisions on false news in Pakistan, the Government formed a committee led by the Minister for the Interior to create a legislative framework for preventing the spread of \"disinformation and fake news\" about the COVID-19 pandemic on social media. In the meantime, existing legislation criminalizing \"statements conducive to public mischief\" is used."

In El Salvador, the protection of journalists became a matter of parliamentary control, and the Legislative Assembly created a special commission to investigate digital attacks against journalists. However, the constitutionality of anti-media policies was not challenged in the courts. It appears that South Africa was the only country among all jurisdictions researched where regulations implementing the Disaster Management Act were the subject of judicial review. Even though the Court found various parts of the regulations unconstitutional, the ruling did not apply to provisions that criminalize misinformation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, provisions penalizing the distribution of false news were challenged in the High Court of Kenya, but no contradiction between them and constitutionally protected freedom of speech has been found."

The law specifically does not restrict the freedom of expression and dissemination of thoughts. Both legislative enactments were in force for a month. However, according to news reports, the Government of El Salvador is among those governments that, when declaring a state of emergency to combat the pandemic, have imposed restrictions on the movements of journalists.

For instance, according to a news report dated March 16, 2020, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations of the National Police Service arrested a 23 year old man for publishing misleading and alarming information relating to the pandemic.[12] The same source also noted that the person would be charged under the \"publication of false information\" clause of the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crimes Act.[13] Another news report, dated April 24, 2020, noted that a 41 year old man was arrested and faced prosecution under the same Act for a tweet claiming \"that he'd heard there was an outbreak in Mombasa, the strategically vital port for east Africa.\"[14]"

Violations of freedom of expression and information have become \"acute\" since a political crisis broke out in April 2018. The censorship challenges have remained during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the government has denied independent and international media participation in Ministry of Health briefings regarding the pandemic. The data related to the pandemic is centralized and kept in secrecy. Health professionals who demanded transparency from the government with respect to pandemic-related information were fired from public hospitals by the Ministry of Health. The independent COVID-19 Nicaraguan Citizen's Observatory monitoring the pandemic publishes weekly data that radically contrasts with the data provided by the government. International institutions including the Pan American Health Organization have repeatedly asked the government of Nicaragua to be more transparent with information related to the pandemic."

                "content": "Due to the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, every former Soviet country included in this survey has introduced restrictive measures, often including stricter regulation of the media. Many used this opportunity to address longstanding questions surrounding online media regulations. Measures introduced by individual governments aimed to install new regulatory systems and varied from establishing new regulators to amending existing criminal and administrative laws. Almost all of these measures were met with fierce criticism from local, regional, and international media watchdogs. Authorities of all the countries researched justified their efforts to restrict media freedoms and impose more censorship on COVID-19-related news coverage by the need to counter the so-called \"fake news\" problem. The newly adopted legislation typically fails to provide accurate definitions of the many terms related to electronic media activities or determine what exactly constitutes \"fake news.\" In many instances, media observers have criticized legislative changes, citing the danger of eroding freedom of speech. While governments of the majority of the countries reviewed were successful in adopting new regulations, some had to retract proposed draft laws, and some are still at the public debate stage with final decisions expected later in 2020. Georgia and Turkmenistan are not included in this survey because no media-related legislation has been considered in these countries since the pandemic began. A report on Azerbaijan is provided separately."

These regulatory activities have introduced amendments to existing laws on the media and to administrative and criminal codes. In some instances, these activities were linked to the introduction of a states of emergency and declarations that measures taken were \"temporary.\" Several amendments introduced a new vocabulary and definitions of terms, though in many instances these definitions were considered vague. Among them are such terms as \"fake news,\" \"online media owner,\" and \"an authorized state body for media regulations.\" Observers have emphasized that such terms as \"social media,\" \"individual bloggers,\" and \"registration requirements\" were not clearly defined and their legal status remains uncertain in many instances. Independent media experts, journalists, media owners, and other civil society representatives have criticized the regulatory changes and advocated with mixed success against them."

It emphasized that all COVID-19-related information published in the Armenian media must not contradict official information and must reproduce officially distributed information.3 Any reporting in violation of these rules should be deleted and removed by the publisher.4 Radio Liberty reported that, threatened by fines in an amount equal to US$1,600, media outlets were forced to remove or edit their stories. Reportedly, these stories covered the spread of the coronavirus in Russia and in Armenian prisons.5 These requirements were cancelled within about a month even though the state of emergency was extended.

Subsections (1) and (2) of section 39 of the Constitution [the interpretation of Bill of rights clause] give guidance as to the interpretation of both the rights and the enactment, essentially requiring them to be interpreted so as to promote the value system of an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. If upon such analysis no limitation is found, that is the end of the matter. The constitutional challenge is dismissed there and then... If there is indeed a limitation, however, the second stage ensues. This is ordinarily called the limitations exercise. In essence this requires a weighing-up of the nature and importance of the right(s) that are limited together with the extent of the limitation as against the importance and purpose of the limiting enactment. Section 36(1) of the Constitution spells out these factors that have to be put into the scales in making a proportional evaluation of all the counterpoised rights and interests involved.[10]"
