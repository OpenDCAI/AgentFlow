We outline a stable training approach from inception, an alignment recipe, and an architectural parameterization tailored for the early-fusion, token-based, mixed-modal setting. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive range of tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, text generation, image generation, and long-form mixed modal generation. Chameleon demonstrates broad and general capabilities, including state-of-the-art performance in image captioning tasks, outperforms Llama-2 in text-only tasks while being competitive with models such as Mixtral 8x7B and Gemini-Pro, and performs non-trivial image generation, all in a single model. It also matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, according to human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation, where either the prompt or outputs contain mixed sequences of both images and text. Chameleon marks a significant step forward in a unified modeling of full multimodal documents."

This can limit their ability to integrate information across modalities and generate multimodal documents that can contain arbitrary sequences of images and text. In this paper, we present Chameleon, a family of mixed-modal foundation models capable of generating and reasoning with mixed sequences of arbitrarily interleaved textual and image content (Figures 2-4). This allows for full multimodal document modeling, which is a direct generalization of standard multimodal tasks such as image generation, understanding and reasoning over images, and text-only LLMs. Chameleon is instead designed to be mixed-model from inception and uses a uniform architecture trained from scratch in an end-to-end fashion on an interleaved mixture of all modalities, i.e., images, text, and code."

This early-fusion approach, where all modalities are projected into a shared representational space from the start, allows for seamless reasoning and generation across modalities. However, it also presents significant technical challenges, particularly in terms of optimization stability and scaling."

We further show how to adapt the supervised finetuning approaches used for text-only LLMs to the mixed-modal setting, enabling strong alignment at scale (Section 3). Using these techniques, we successfully train Chameleon-34B on 5x the number of tokens as Llama-2 - enabling new mixed-modal applications while still matching or even outperforming existing LLMs on unimodal benchmarks."

Given the importance of generating human faces, we up-sample the percentage of images with faces during pre-training by 2 times. A core weakness of our tokenizer is in reconstructing images with a large amount of text, therefore upper bounding the capability of our models, when it comes to heavy OCR-related tasks."

We narrowed down the cause of the divergence to the softmax operation being problematic when training with multiple modalities of significantly varying entropy due to the translation invariant property of softmax (i.e., \\( \\text{softmax}(z) = \\text{softmax}(z + c) \\)). Because we share all weights of the model across modalities, each modality will try to \"compete\" with the other by increasing its norms slightly; while not problematic at the beginning of training, it manifests in divergences once we get outside the effective representation range of bf16 (In Figure 6b, we show that ablations without image generation did not diverge). In a unimodal setting, this problem has also been named the logit drift problem (Wortsman et al., 2023). In Figure 5a, we plot the norms of the output of the last transformer layer as training progresses and we find that although training divergences can manifest after as much as even \\( 20 - 30\\% \\) of training progress, monitoring uncontrolled growth of output norms is strongly correlated with predicting future loss divergence."

The benefit of the Swin transformer normalization strategy is that it bounds the norm growth of the feedforward block, which can become additionally problematic given the multiplicate nature of the SwiGLU activation function.

In the background, blurry green vegetation is visible, creating a contrast to the autumnal theme of the bouquet. The red maple leaves, both in the arrangement and scattered around the vase, evoke autumn, while the green vegetation suggests a more summer-like setting. The outdoor setting is bright and sunny, adding to the contrast between the arrangement and its settings."

However, readers should be aware of the limitations of human evaluation. First, the prompts used in the evaluation came from crowdsourcing instead of real users who interact with a model. While we certainly have a diverse set of prompts, the coverage may still be limited, given the size of the dataset. Second, partially because our prompts focus on the mixed-modal output, certain visual understanding tasks, such as OCR or Infographics (i.e., interpreting a given chart or plot), are naturally excluded from our evaluation. Finally, at this moment, the APIs of existing multi-modal LLMs provide only textual responses.

The idea of using discrete tokens to represent continuous modalities like images was first explored in works like BEiT (Bao et al., 2021), which proposed a self-supervised vision representation learning method based on tokenized image patches. Aghajanyan et al. (2022) extended this idea to learning from mixed-modal documents through interleaved image and text tokens, allowing for joint reasoning over both modalities within a unified architecture. CM3Leon (Yu et al., 2023) further scaled up this approach to autoregressive text-to-image generation, building on the initial proposal of token-based image generation in DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021)."

In contrast, Chameleon's unified token space allows it to seamlessly reason over and generate interleaved image and text sequences, without the need for modality-specific components. This early-fusion approach, however, comes with significant challenges in terms of representation learning and alignment, as discussed in Baltrusaitis et al. (2018)."

This makes Chameleon a more general-purpose model for both multimodal understanding and generation tasks, similar in spirit to the Perceiver (Jaegle et al., 2021) architecture which also aims for a unified model across modalities and tasks."

On tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, Chameleon-34B outperforms models such as Flamingo and IDEFICS, while maintaining competitive performance on text-only benchmarks.
