In cases where the next of kin wishes to repatriate the body, or cremated remains, to the foreign national's country of origin, the Home Office will pay up to £3,000 (approximately US\\)3,700) towards this.

The Head of Detention Operations appears to have discretion to provide further funds towards the funeral costs and repatriation of foreign nationals, but the limits of this discretion are not provided in the detention services order."
