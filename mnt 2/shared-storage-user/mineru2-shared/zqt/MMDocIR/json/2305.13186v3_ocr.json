We present SCITAB, a challenging evaluation dataset consisting of 1.2K expert-verified scientific claims that 1) originate from authentic scientific publications and 2) require compositional reasoning for verification. The claims are paired with evidence-containing scientific tables annotated with labels. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that SCITAB poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art models, including table-based pretraining models and large language models. All models except GPT-4 achieved performance barely above random guessing. Popular prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought, do not achieve much performance gains on SCITAB. Our analysis uncovers several unique challenges posed by SCITAB, including table grounding, claim ambiguity, and compositional reasoning.

This leads to problems such as bias in human annotation, a lack of diversity, and shallow claims that do not reflect the complexity of scientific reasoning. For example, most claims in Sci-Fact can be validated by a single sentence in a paper's abstract, which oversimplifies the scientific discourse. Second, the claims in the existing benchmarks are solely validated against text-based evidence, primarily paper abstracts. However, in many scientific processes, claims are intrinsically tied to quantitative experimental data, commonly presented in tables and figures. This disparity highlights a significant gap between the existing benchmarks and real-world scientific fact-checking needs. To bridge these gaps, a dataset that 1) compiles real-world claims from scientific papers, and 2) includes original scientific data such as tables and figures, is needed."

Our data is derived from the SciGen dataset (Moosavi et al., 2021), a resource that includes scientific tables and claims crawled from arXiv.org. We first manually filter out the checkworthy scientific claims from the raw data. Following this, we employ a strategy of human-model collaboration, as depicted in Figure 2, to generate claims that are either contradicted or unverifiable based on the table's content. Figure 1 shows a claim from SCITAB and the corresponding reasoning process to verify it. Compared with existing benchmarks, SCITAB is closer to real-world scientific fact-checking in terms of more realistic claims and table-based evidence. Through data analysis, we further show that the claims in SCITAB necessitate a more comprehensive and nuanced set of reasoning skills for verification, e.g., numerical rea"

This decision was based on a pilot annotation which showed that a well-trained annotator can achieve over \\(95\\%\\) accuracy in filtering scientific claims. To safeguard the quality, we include an option to mark the claim as “Discard-It’s not a claim, or it’s an incomplete, or not grammatically correct sentence.” during the subsequent claim verification process.

Following SciFact (Wadden et al., 2020) and COVID-Fact (Saakyan et al., 2021), we seek to create false claims by generating counter-claims of the original true claims. Unlike previous works that purely rely on crowd-workers to compose counter-claims — a process that is costly and prone to annotation artifacts — we leverage the strong instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist humans in generating candidate counter-claims. Specifically, we prompt InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) with the original claim and the instruction: Please modify the original claims to convey the opposite meaning with minimum edits. To foster a varied set of generated claims, we include five diverse in-context examples and employ a high decoding temperature setting of 0.7. By mandating minimal edits, we ensure that the counter-claims remain lexically close to the original claims, which is crucial in preventing fact-checking models from relying on superficial lexical patterns for verification."

Open-domain knowledge refers to commonsense knowledge not presented in the table, e.g., the relationship between precision and recall. Given the designed reasoning types, we manually analyze 100 samples in SCITAB, by annotating the graph of reasoning steps for verifying each claim. We identify 476 atomic reasoning steps from the 100 analyzed samples and show the proportion for each reasoning type in Table 2.

For cases where 'supported' or 'refuted' claims are erroneously predicted as 'NEI' (Cases 1 and 2), such claims typically demand extensive reasoning and a deep understanding of the research findings.

We present the error analysis in Table 5, and examples of program errors can be found in Figure 13 and Figure 14 in Appendix G. Compared to other datasets, categories (i) and (ii) present unique challenges in our dataset. Category (i) underlines the difficulty in accurately referencing the specific cells to which a claim refers. Category (ii), on the other hand, emphasizes the difficulties posed by the ambiguous nature of scientific claims, such as “A is significantly better than B”, to program-based methods.

However, most of these datasets rely on text evidence to verify claims. SEM-TAB-FACTS (Wang et al., 2021) is the only existing dataset based on scientific tables, but it is limited to simple, crowd-sourced claims. To bridge this gap, we construct SCITAB which contains complex claims from authentic scientific papers with table-based evidence."

                "content": "Table-based Reasoning. Table-based reasoning requires reasoning over both free-form natural language queries and (semi-)structured tables. Early works either rely on executable languages (e.g., SQL and SPARQL) to access the tabular data (Yin et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018) or employ graph neural networks to capture logical structure in statements, e.g., LogicFactChecker (Zhong et al., 2020) and ProgVGAT (Yang et al., 2020). However, these approaches often struggle with generalization, as they are tightly bound to specific table formats and language patterns. To address this, we have seen a shift toward table pre-training, with the advent of TableBERT (Chen et al., 2020), TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020), SaMoE (Zhou et al., 2022), PASTA (Gu et al., 2022), and DATER (Ye et al., 2023). These methods encode sentence-table pairs using language models and transform table-based reasoning into question-answering or natural language inference. In our work, we focus on evaluating pretraining-based methods on SCITAB because they not only demonstrate superior performance but also offer the benefits of few-shot learning."

For example, we believe that addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous claims represents a crucial direction for research in scientific fact-checking (Glockner et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). One potential approach is to enhance the disambiguation of ambiguous claims by leveraging contextual information or external knowledge sources. Additionally, studying the compositionality in table-based reasoning is an interesting direction. Consider the work of Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022), which proposed the \"compositionality gap\" metric to measure the capability of LLMs in compositional reasoning. Such evaluations can be enriched by annotating SCITAB with ground-truth reasoning depths and structured reasoning graphs. Beyond this, another direction worth exploring is equipping the LLMs with external tools to further improve the model. For example, the use of GPT-4 plugins, Program-guided Fact-Checking (Pan et al., 2023) or adopting approaches from other tool-augmented LLMs like Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) and Chameleon (Lu et al., 2023)."

Initially, we planned to rely solely on LLMs for generating NEI claims. Our criteria for the NEI claim is that “the claim should be fluent, logical, and relevant to the table. However, the claim cannot be verified as true or false solely based on the information in the table.” However, after a careful examination of the LLM output, we found that LLM tends to generate claims that are either not logical or irrelevant to the table content. Therefore, human efforts are required to further select NEI claims that meet our criteria. Out of 900 initial NEI claims generated by LLMs, manual verification narrowed them down to only 355 claims, taking up \\(40\\%\\) of the original count. While it may not have served as crucial a role as filtering NEI claims, human verification also safeguarded the data quality in other annotation processes. For example, among the “supported” claims originally appearing in the scientific paper, human validation still identified 10 cases that were actually not supported (e.g., wrong number matching.)"

For full COPA, RoBERTa-large has an overall performance of 87.7 (table[6,2]), while BERT-large has an overall performance of 76.5 (table[3,2]).

For balanced COPA, RoBERTa-large has an overall performance of 89.0 (table[4,2]), while BERT-large has an overall performance of 74.5 (table[1,2]).
