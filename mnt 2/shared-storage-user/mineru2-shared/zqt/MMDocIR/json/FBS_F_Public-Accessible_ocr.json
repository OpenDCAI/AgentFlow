Staff must also dedicate time to elaborate business rules, participate in user testing, and learn how to interact with new systems and processes. F staff must also conduct outreach and provide change management support for other bureaus engaged in the budgeting process. While there are cadres of staff currently dedicated to these improvement efforts, annual changes in resource allocation or competing priorities may jeopardize the timely completion of sub-objective milestones. More broadly, efforts to increase process efficiency may have trade-offs with the amount of consultation and feedback that can be integrated from stakeholders. Efforts to mitigate this risk include providing regular updates to senior leadership on milestones and using quantitative metrics to underscore the long-term benefits of increasing digitalization in the department. Staff members engaged in these efforts have explicit links between performance goals and achievement of these milestones, which also helps to mitigate risks."

Employee capacity to take on new assignments that would be produced to successfully accomplish the sub-objectives may be limited. The need for change management support for new processes may impede the momentum of updating an established system with data gaps. Finally, if the employees do not have access to systems or if the data is not collected in the required fashion, the full potential of the outcome may not be realized. To mitigate these risks, early leadership buy-in and working level coordination on the creation of joint teams will be essential. To avoid adding burdensome workloads on staff, financial data should be gathered from existing systems and from bureaus who already have data collection processes established."

Two key elements of effective foreign assistance are staff capacity and coordination. Staff who understand how to plan, manage, and evaluate foreign assistance can better leverage these funds to advance U.S. policy priorities. Likewise, missions and bureaus that coordinate foreign assistance well internally and with the interagency are best positioned to integrate diverse interests into effective whole of government solutions. This strategy's SWOT analysis and previous assessments have identified gaps in staff ability to manage foreign assistance, and varying levels of coordination between regions, bureaus, and missions. F, as a joint USAID-State bureau, will convene stakeholders to investigate, develop, and share the tools that will improve both staff foreign assistance capacity and institutional coordination of foreign assistance. This goal supports the JSP and the Secretary's modernization agenda which call for investing in our diplomatic and development workforce to advance American interests."

Improved coordination is a proven path to reducing redundancies and better leveraging our core competencies. The first step to improving coordination is to understand how F’s current processes operate not only within the Department but within USAID and other interagency partner organizations as well. Initially F will bring key stakeholders together to establish a common understanding of the issues and develop a plan to address them collectively. F has identified several potential avenues for better coordination between units (e.g., enhancing the MfR Communities at State, enhancing FACTS to better link updates between processes, creating additional training materials, workshops, speaker series, and more) but seek wider stakeholder input and buy-in to prioritize our efforts. Once a plan has been created and agreed to, F will identify new sub-objectives within the F FBS to prioritize critical elements of that plan. F will also seek to establish foreign assistance points of contact with relevant bureaus and missions as a point of entry for improved coordination. This objective directly supports JSP Objective 4.1 as well as every objective that leverages foreign assistance resources."

To achieve this, F will serve as a knowledge hub connecting the right information to the right people at the right time to inform decisions. Evidence analyzed by F, as well as the learning from sound performance management in Bureaus and Missions, should be considered alongside Administration policy goals, Congressional directives, and other strategic imperatives by Senior leadership when making decisions related to Foreign Assistance. F's core function is to coordinate foreign assistance, and its success in promoting evidence-based decision-making relies upon the collection, analysis, and appropriate dissemination of high-quality data, information, and visualizations from multiple stakeholders in a timely manner. F is uniquely situated to not only to conduct cross-cutting analysis on the foreign assistance data that Missions and Bureaus collect, but also to establish standards, policies, and best practices to improve the quality, availability, and use of data and evidence throughout the Department. F will seek to build upon the progress made since the establishment of centrally collected, standardized programming information over the past ten years, and evolve to the next phase to elevate the information that F manages to be more strategic and outcome oriented. To this end, F will continue efforts to improve performance management practices of Bureaus and Missions to increase data-driven decisions by their leadership, as well as expand the evidence base available for F to utilize in our direct research and analysis. F's ability to conduct cross-sectoral analysis requires a strong foundation of information sharing and knowledge management that follow common data governance practices so that data are readily available and useable.

As demand grows without sufficient structure, F runs the risk of not meeting data-related demands from stakeholders, and missing opportunities for providing proactive data analysis along all its lines of business as is now required by both Senior Department leadership and Congress. The primary risks to F achieving this objective are staff resources and time to make the necessary updates the systems and tools envisioned. Moreover, systems that contain foreign assistance data involve external stakeholders to help maintain and keep up to date to ensure data quality. Therefore, there is a risk that the participants in the data life cycle and data systems will adhere to new guidance and data management strategies. Steps to mitigate these risks will include securing high-level leadership buy-in within and outside of F and buy-in by all relevant stakeholders through socialization on the improvements and guidance created to improve data quality."

While data has been integrated into decision making for many years, the piecemeal nature of its availability and scope has impeded its full adoption and the benefits that come with it. If a data dependent environment is to exist, it cannot be implemented or resourced as an optional activity as resources allow. The funding for development of systems and tools, capacity building for staff, and maintenance of infrastructure must be prioritized and built into Bureau resource requests. In this strategy, F is committing to work toward a comprehensive and standardized data environment that support decision making across the U.S. foreign assistance realm. This must include the prioritization and funding of systems and tools development, staff capacity building, evidence collection and dissemination, and continual process improvement. This objective directly supports JSP objective 4.2."

Moreover, if F does not invest in building a pipeline of evidence creation, then it cannot effectively implement evidence-based decision making. If this occurs, leadership and foreign assistance stakeholders would experience increased frustration at being constrained by outdated inputs that do not allow for data-driven decisions and staff would be constrained by antiquated and time-consuming practices. To mitigate these risks F is committing in this objective to prioritize availability of data, evidence, and learning. Achieving this objective will require investment in tools, systems and people. As with all federal appropriations, future funding for investment is never guaranteed. F will work to mitigate this risk by integrating resource planning for these activities into regular budget formulation and execution processes of foreign assistance."

It is not enough to simply require evidence collection and support sound data management processes. It is imperative to ensure these efforts result in useful analytic products and data that can inform foreign assistance decision making. Objective 4.3 builds sequentially from the improved data quality and availability achieved through Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 by putting data to use in decision making processes. Sub-objective 4.3.1 leverages insights gained from implementation of the Evidence Act, including the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment, to identify challenges and best practices for using data and evidence across the department. These lessons and recommendations will feed into the development of practical guidance and tools for staff to integrate data, evidence, and learning at different points in foreign assistance planning and implementation including budget formulation and execution, operational planning, and strategy processes (sub-objective 4.3.2). To complement guidance and tools, sub-objective 4.3.3 considers the importance of setting expectations and incentives from the top-down and seeks to increase the role of F and department leadership to signal the importance of evidence-based decision-making."

To mitigate these factors, we will leverage F leadership, the F DEI Council, F’s Management Office, and State/GTM and USAID/HCTM expertise to prioritize and model a DEIA culture and meet our sub-objectives and milestones."

On behalf of the Secretary of State, F optimizes the impact of foreign assistance by strategically aligning foreign assistance resources to the Secretary's overarching foreign policy goals, measuring effectiveness, and promoting evidence-based policies, including budget formulation, justification, and execution mechanisms. The combination of Civil Service, Foreign Service, contractors, and detailees brings a variety of experience, skills, and challenges to this diverse but unified organization. Due to the hybrid structure of F, there is greater complexity involved in the application of State and USAID policies and regulations, requiring additional staff time and coordination efforts not present in other traditional bureaus. Furthermore, hiring mechanisms between the two agencies vary including the experiences of staff members. As such, F leadership and senior managers have greater requirements to address management, operations, and administrative issues as many items are dependent of other offices and not under F's direct control and purview. Linkages to JSP objectives relate to 4.1 \"Build and equip a diverse, inclusive, resilient, and dynamic workforce,\" with enhanced training, development, and work life programs, among other things. Specifically, this includes Joint Agency Priority Goal 4.1.3 of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accountability: \"Expand inclusive and equitable recruitment, hiring and retention practices that result in diverse Department of State and USAID workforces.\" (See also F Management Cross-cutting Objective 1)."
