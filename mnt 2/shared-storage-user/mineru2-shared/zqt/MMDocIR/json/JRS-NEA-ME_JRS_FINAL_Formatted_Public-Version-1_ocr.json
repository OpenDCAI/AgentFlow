These challenges have implications across all sectors and disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. The rise of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia, both as global strategic competitors and regional influencers, and the continued influence of Iran, are the core challenges for U.S. foreign policy in the coming decade, and therefore addressed as a cross-cutting priority under this strategy. Our diplomatic, economic, and development tools and investments will help us meet these challenges by building stronger ties with partners in the region."

Likewise, the countries that will be best equipped to meet the security challenges of our changing world will be those with resilient, inclusive governments that treat civil society as a partner rather than a threat, and that recognize the fundamental rights of their people, including freedom from oppression, freedom of expression and association, and freedom of the press. We will continue pressing governments to reduce corruption to increase their legitimacy and win the trust of the people they serve."

We know that communities and countries that have meaningful participation and leadership from women have better outcomes on virtually every development indicator, including, perhaps most importantly, peace and security. The data conclusively demonstrate that when women thrive, entire countries thrive — it is a strategic imperative. Georgetown University's Institute for Women, Peace, and Security provides ample data about the role women play in peace and security. In their Women, Peace, and Security Index, released on October 19, 2021, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and the Palestinian Authority ranked among the ten worst countries in the world for women's inclusion, justice, and security. By contrast, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where conflict and instability pale in comparison to elsewhere in the region, ranked 24th, just two behind the United States. Through innovative diplomacy, it is time we engage the region in new ways with evidence-based approaches that put women and girls at the forefront of peace and security decision-making, as well as meaningful economic and political participation and leadership."

The pandemic is reshuffling the global economy, shutting down some sectors and spurring growth in others. In the MENA region, these changes are exacerbating pre-existing economic, political, and social vulnerabilities, and are threatening to further deepen challenges pertaining to female labor force participation and, in some countries, reversing vital progress in women's employment. As economies navigate the post-COVID terrain, the region's public and private sectors must work together to protect women's employment and support their re-entry to the workforce."

Countries in the Gulf are already experiencing temperatures so high that they threaten to make outdoor life unlivable, while the countries of the Fertile Crescent have endured historic levels of drought that have decimated food crops. Nearly 60 percent of the region's population is exposed to high water stress, and approximately 52 million people in the region are chronically undernourished. Increased water scarcity further drives food insecurity and with it, migration, instability, and conflict. These challenges are particularly serious in countries like Syria, where 9.3 million people, more than half the population, are food insecure, or in Yemen, where 16 million people require food aid."

In the MENA region, we want to continue the U.S. Government's leading role in diplomacy and people-to-people development initiatives. Our support of a rules-based international order, girded by our global alliances and participation in the multilateral arena, provide the foundation for regional security. The Department of State is at the forefront of preventing regional and global adversaries — both nation-states and non-state actors — from directly threatening our partners and citizens, while USAID leads in engagement and program implementation with civil society and governance organizations to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and healthy world. National security efforts build on the strong foundation of U.S. cooperative security partnerships in law enforcement and defense institutions that prevent, deter, resolve conflicts, counter terrorism, and address current and future regional security challenges."

Disruptive geo-political influence from Russia, the PRC, and Iran heighten instability and conflict vulnerabilities and worsen developmental and humanitarian outcomes in an already complex and fragile region.

As the region struggles to proactively diversify the economy away from the oil industry, spur growth and enhance equity across the region, we recognize that gender diversity in the public and private sectors will bring a variety of experience and talent that is likely to have positive spillover effects on economics. Economic diversification is essential in order to address the climate crisis while creating opportunities for youth and underprivileged populations in emerging green industries. Inclusive growth is particularly essential to effectively respond and recover from COVID-19 given the disproportionate impact faced by women, including increased caregiving burdens, heightened risks of gender-based violence, and greater job losses. Compared to other regions, the Arab states saw the second highest decline in women's labor force participation during the pandemic (with the exception of Saudi Arabia). That said, women have been leaders on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response, and their leadership should carry into recovery efforts. To support a foundation of financial stability and prosperity, it is critical to promote conditions inclusive of women and youth in particular, and conducive to private sector risk taking, job creation, and open market access."

Such informal businesses are limited in their growth potential and ability to attract investment. Governments also do not receive tax revenue from informal businesses, further inhibiting governments' ability to build capacity and invest in the infrastructure that contributes to a stronger, more reliable business enabling environment. In turn, it is more difficult to attract foreign investment into these markets."

Diversifying economies to strengthen regional health security better positions MENA to prevent and respond to biothreats like COVID-19. Ensuring that women, youth, and underrepresented populations can meaningfully participate in the formal economy, particularly to recover from the pandemic and combat the climate crisis, will improve economic resilience long term. Ensuring that these marginalized communities are equipped with the necessary skills and education, coupled with the removal of cultural and legal barriers, results in more inclusive economic opportunities and growth. In turn, this creates a more responsive and enabling environment which can then be leveraged to drive further change. Women's economic empowerment benefits all members of society and is a crucial prerequisite to a sustainable and strong economy, while increased participation contributes to slowing and reversing the gender and wage gaps in the workforce. This objective supports key overarching goals including strengthening global health security, especially among vulnerable populations, and reducing the gender gap in access to finance, as outlined in JSP Goal 1.1 and 2.2."

The Arab Spring was in part a response to limited opportunities among marginalized and disadvantaged groups, particularly youth. Additionally, without opportunities for education and employment, certain marginalized groups may take their skills elsewhere, potentially leading to brain drain or insufficient demographic support from the prime working-age population. Marginalized groups without economic opportunities in formal sectors may also seek employment in informal sectors or by joining new ideological movements, exposing themselves to dangerous or exploitative practices. For women, a lack of economic opportunity in the MENA region can also exacerbate societal gender imbalances and inhibit social progress. Furthermore, inclusive workforces drive economic growth and recovery, which is paramount to respond to second order impacts of COVID-19."

We will encourage governments to work with the private sector in the region and transnationally to curtail digital authoritarianism and increase respect for human dignity, especially for women and marginalized populations, in dialogues with our partners."

Additional risks result from differences between the U.S. Government's strong emphasis on equity and inclusion of marginalized groups, women and girls, and youth, and the region's social and cultural norms, political aims, and economic interests. To mitigate the effects of this risk, we will continually assess opportunities and risks in our programming and work with governments to improve the legal operating environment. We will work through local stakeholders, including community-based organizations and youth-led organizations, to navigate barriers to participation, equity, and inclusion so that civil society not only has space to exist but can also exercise their right to hold governments accountable."

Climate change in MENA drives instability, water and food scarcity, conflict over resources, and migration that further exacerbate regional fragility and economic insecurity, all of which are compounded by COVID-19. The Paris Agreement, which the United States played a leading role in negotiating, is the framework for the global response to this crisis. While most countries in the MENA region have signed the Paris Agreement, their Nationally Determined Contributions are not aligned with achieving 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and keeping 1.5 degree warming in reach. Given that Egypt will host the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 27), followed by the UAE in 2023 (COP 28), there is greater interest in climate action across the region presenting us with a window of opportunity to increase climate ambition and meaningful action to impact long term climate outcomes in the region."

There will likely be many years before a complete transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles begins, although several auto manufacturers have announced plans to phase out the sale of new combustion engines by 2035, and President Biden has set a goal to achieve 50 percent EV sales by 2030. CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in the Middle East have grown from 1.059 billion tons in 2000 to 2.164 billion tons in 2019. This is underscored by the region's increasing consumption of its own oil and gas products, with oil consumption having grown over the same period, reaching 17.8 million bpd in 2019. Despite decades of warning from the scientific community that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion are leading to global impacts such as water resource depletion, short-term gains in fossil fuel revenues have continued to drive policy decisions. This will be a very difficult habit to break. Furthermore, near-term action to mitigate methane emissions from oil and gas will be needed to meet the 1.5C Paris target in addition to longer-term decarbonization efforts."

The impacts of climate change are especially severe in the MENA region, as evidenced by rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and desertification. In turn, these impacts increase water and food insecurity; augment the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases; agricultural pests; and social inequality, all of which contribute to conflict, destabilization, and an increase in migration and internally displaced populations. To address these emerging threats as outlined in Goal 1.2 and 2.4 of the JSP and E.O. 13990, we must support climate-resilient water management practices that focus on sustainable watershed and aquifer management, advance the use of non-conventional water resources, harness the power of science and technology, promote gender equity and equality, and embrace private sector engagement. The adoption of a One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnection between people, animals, and their shared environment, is key to success in this area, and consistent with USG priorities across multiple departments and agencies, including USAID, CDC, USDA, DOI, and NOAA. One Health is also embedded in the National Biodefense Strategy and other key strategies."

We need to include a broad universe of stakeholders, including a spectrum of leaders to understand opportunities of a net-zero economy, including from business, government, academia, civil society and local communities. This presents the U.S. with a data-driven opportunity to meaningfully engage and economically empower women, youth, and marginalized populations to not only combat the climate crisis, but also recover from and thrive in a post-pandemic world. No country can solve the climate crisis alone, particularly in MENA where climate change is undeniably interconnected to complex conflict, instability, and inequality. Everyone must do their part, and we must harness the potential of all people to tackle this crisis. Evidence increasingly demonstrates that empowering women — politically, economically, and socially — and meaningfully including their needs and perspectives in decision-making leads to more equitable and sustainable policies. The INSSG and JSP both prioritize climate action and gender equity, presenting us with an opportunity to explore the gender-climate nexus in MENA, as seen in every other region across the globe."

From a societal perspective, the risk of not achieving this objective is perpetuating a system that has inherently favored some people over others, and which has created social tension, inequity, and injustices that have spanned generations. Additionally, the continued marginalization and neglect of DEIA creates serious national security vulnerabilities, limiting the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy and widening the gap of future policy experts ill prepared and equipped with diverse perspectives on societal fragility and global unrest. We must also acknowledge that racism and discrimination are traumatic and cause real health impacts. Diverse and marginalized groups often live with posttraumatic stress, and in order to mitigate further harm and improve retention, both agencies must adopt a trauma-informed approach across human resources practices and management efforts."
