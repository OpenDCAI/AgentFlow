The JSP identifies the Department's strategic goals and objectives and provides an active \"roadmap\" that prioritizes accomplishments in support of the Administration's policy priorities over a four-year period. GTM is most active in realizing the Secretary's JSP Goal Four – Revitalize the Diplomatic and Development Workforce and Infrastructure. This is the foundation of GTM's FBS – how we build and equip a diverse, inclusive, resilient, and dynamic workforce that effectively serves U.S. interests at home and abroad, including by modernizing and securing information technology, as called for in the JSP. In addition to aligning with the JSP, this FBS directly encompasses the goals and objectives enunciated by the recent and ongoing National Security Memorandum-3 / National Security Workforce Working Group (NSWWG) process; the Department's first Learning Agenda; and the Secretary's Modernizing American Diplomacy agenda; as well as concurrent internal strategic planning on enterprise data, climate adaptation and resilience, diversity and inclusion, and mobility policy."

Retaining High Quality Talent has become critical as the Department faces a tough skilled labor environment with fierce competition from the private sector. Through establishing a Retention Unit and building out the Department's exit survey and interview capabilities, GTM will gain an in-depth understanding of why employees stay at the Department of State and why they leave, enabling the remediation and development of new strategies to enhance employee retention. Expanding and promoting opportunities for professional development will also be critical for retention."

GTM is also participating in DEIA barrier analyses to pinpoint existing obstacles among specific workforce segments, including those with disabilities, which is an important part of our overall retention effort. The Department's congressional oversight committees also place significant priority on these efforts. In terms of Transforming the Customer Experience, technology and adaptation will play a key role in establishing a culture of excellence in customer service and in line with Executive Order 14058 on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government. GTM will develop and enhance partnerships that bring best practices from the private and NGO sectors. Finally, our FBS Management Objective to leverage data and technology to drive informed decision making is critical, as is a commitment to investment in IT infrastructure. This is best achieved by synchronizing GTM's efforts with the Secretary's new Center for Data Analytics and the new Chief Data Officer (CDO) in executing the Department's ambitious new Enterprise Data Strategy."

GTM meticulously utilizes the Department's budget request and review process, with support of congressional oversight committees, to enhance the Department's global workforce. The proposed FY 2022 plus up of the Department's and GTM's annual budget, the strong interest in DEIA and climate adaptation issues from the Administration and Congress, and pending legislation to fund student interns, support GTM's efforts. GTM plans to use these and other newly appropriated funds to build out data and modelling capabilities within GTM to more expeditiously hire a diverse and talented workforce and retain them for the long term."

External factors include: the availability of sufficient pools of qualified candidates, uncompetitive salaries for certain occupations, and a cumbersome Civil Service hiring process managed by the Office of Personnel Management. Risks for not achieving this objective include the inability of the Department to adequately staff overseas missions and recruit the specific skills sets it needs to achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives. To mitigate these risks, GTM will continue to take steps to streamline the hiring and onboarding process for both Civil Service and Foreign Service and will broaden outreach efforts to attract more candidates from under-represented groups."
