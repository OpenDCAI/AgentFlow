Those who trade as drone service providers for hire or reward must hold a remotely piloted aircraft operator's certificate (ReOC) and can then employ RePL holders to operate drones for the business. To obtain a RePL, a person must take a training course provided by a certified RePL training provider and pass the required theory and practical skills tests for the type and category of RPA he or she intends to fly. The person must also log at least five hours of flying time with the relevant type of drone. Once the requirements have been met, the RePL training provider applies to CASA for a RePL on the person's behalf. The units, standards, and testing requirements for the training courses are set out in a legislative instrument. Different units apply for different categories of drone, and a RePL will be issued with respect to only the category that a person is qualified to fly. There are no age restrictions or renewal requirements for RePL."

RPA are regulated by the Aeronautics Act and Part IX of the Canadian Aviation Regulations—the latter being supplemented by standards, guidelines, and circulars issued by Transport Canada. These regulations prescribe terms for lawful drone usage; among them, individuals can find licensing requirements for various types of drone operations. Corporations seeking to fly drones within Canada must satisfy the requirements for a \"Basic\" or \"Advanced\" license; these classes are distinguished by the complexity of their corresponding maneuvers, and not the commercial or recreational nature of their operations. Should commercial drone activities exceed the limitations of their license class, a Special Flight Operations Certificate can be obtained on behalf of one's business. Each class of license, however, presents its own fees, testing requirements, and 24-month recency requirements for maintaining its validity."

These are listed in the CARs.[24] They require that a registrant be at least 14 years of age; a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada; a corporation incorporated under the territorial, provincial, or federal laws of Canada; or a municipal, provincial, or federal entity. However, individuals under the age of 14, although unable to register an sRPA themselves, are permitted to conduct basic operations if under the supervision of the holder of either a basic or an advanced RPA pilot certificate.[25] Further exacting age requirements are requested for registration of an RPA when a pilot intends to conduct advanced operations; he or she must be at least 16 years of age.[26] However, as with aspiring basic operations licensees, the possibility to conduct advanced operations remains open to individuals under 16 years of age, when directly supervised by the holder of an Advanced RPA pilot certificate.[27]"

Under the rules, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are grouped in three categories (aeroplane, rotorcraft, and hybrid Unmanned Aerial System) and five classifications based on their maximum all-up (gross) weight. In order to obtain a remote pilot certificate, an applicant must complete a training program by an authorized remote pilot training organization specified by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The duration of courses varies depending on the category or classification of drones, but most drone training courses are short and can be completed in five to eight days. Within seven days of successfully completing the training and passing the tests, the authorized remote pilot training organization is required to submit an application for remote pilot certificate on the government's online digital sky platform, providing details about the individual who has passed the test. That individual is issued a remote pilot certificate through the same digital sky platform."
