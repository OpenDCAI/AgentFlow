Three weeks later, on 16 November 2021, Alkaloids of Australia also pleaded guilty to three charges and admitted a further seven offences. Mr Joyce and Alkaloids of Australia have been committed to the Federal Court of Australia for sentencing. While all 66 sequences on the initial charge sheets were withdrawn, the remaining charges involved (a) for Alkaloids of Australia, intentionally making and attempting to enter into contracts, arrangements or understandings containing cartel provisions, and giving effect to cartel provisions, involving fixing the sale price of SNBB, fixing bid prices for the supply of SNBB and restricting the supply of SNBB; and (b) for Mr Joyce, aiding, abetting or procuring Alkaloids of Australia's contraventions of the cartel provisions, intentionally attempting to make contracts or arrive at understandings containing cartel provisions or inducing others to do so, and being knowingly concerned in giving effect to cartel provisions. The Alkaloids of Australia case is the fourth criminal cartel case brought by the ACCC that has been resolved by guilty pleas, and the first in which a guilty plea has been entered by an individual in addition to a corporate defendant.[6]"

The generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent at least five times between 2005 and 2007. These agreements violated articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU.

One was to denigrate the Arrow generic in the medical community by implying that there were risks in prescribing it instead of the brand-name drug. The other element was to get pharmacists to saturate their inventory with Subutex by offering them substantial discounts and favorable payment options on large orders.[20]"

Investigation carried-out by the Director General ('DG') revealed involvement of the State Level Association, i.e. the Gujarat Federation, besides CDAB, in the alleged conduct.

Such anti-competitive practices were: (i) requiring pharmaceutical companies in at least some Districts of the State of West Bengal to have their new stockists obtain a prior Stock Availability Information (SAI)/ No Objection Certificate (NOC) from BCDA before the supply of drugs could be commenced to them; (ii) collecting monetary considerations from the prospective stockists against the issuance of SAI to them, through its District Committees; and (iii) requiring promotion cum distributor agents of pharma companies to obtain Product Availability Information (PAI) from BCDA after payment of monetary considerations to it in the form of donations, to start marketing drugs of their respective pharma companies in the State of West Bengal. Further, the Commission found that pharmaceutical companies, namely Alkem and Macleods had an anti-competitive agreement with BCDA whereby these companies, after issuing the offer letter of stockistship to prospective stockists, demanded from them SAI/NOC/Approval Letter/Circulation Letter from BCDA, before supplies of drugs could be commenced to them. For their such conduct, the Commission found Alkem and Macleods liable for contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Act and their various officials have also been found liable by the Commission for such conduct in terms of Section 48 of the Act."

The district court concluded that the excess profits enjoyed by Sanofi during those fifteen months because of its monopolistic status, caused its unlawful enrichment. The court imposed a duty to compensate Unipharm on Sanofi in the amount of 2,600,000 NIS (about US\\(738,683). This amount was determined after Sanofi had accepted the court's suggestion that if it accepted the claim in full, it would not have to report on its full income and profits from the marketing of the drug in the period between filing the registration request and until it withdrew its patent application."

Even if it could be determined that Sanofi harmed competition, it could not be said that it \"took advantage of its position in the market\" to harm competition. Therefore, the fact that Sanofi had a monopoly (if indeed this was the case) had nothing to do with deception.

In particular, it investigated whether there was an abuse of a dominant market position by Leadiant by charging excessive prices. The drug CDCA is used for the treatment of patients with the rare hereditary metabolic disorder cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis (CTX). The investigation was concluded in June 2021 and Leadiant was fined 19,569,500 euros (about US\\(19,680,399).[10] ACM found that Leadiant abused its dominant market position in violation of article 24, paragraph 1 of the DCA by charging excessive prices for its drug CDCA for the period from June 2017 through December 2019.[11] Since June 2017, Leadiant had charged 14,000 euros (about US\\)14,079) for CDCA-Leadiant, more than four times the previous price and over 15 times as high as the price of Xenbilox (the old trade name of CDCA) before Leadiant obtained the orphan drug designation in 2014.[12] ACM concluded that this price was both exorbitantly high and unfair und violated competition law rules.[13] To serve as a deterrent and taking into account additional profits that Leadiant generated, ACM decided to fine the company 19,569,500 euros.[14]"

The [Competition] Bureau continues to express keen interest in bringing such cases to ensure Canadian consumers have access to generic and biosimilar medicines, and the Commissioner [of Competition] has warned the pharmaceutical industry that any further alleged refusals to supply samples of brand-name drugs to generic manufacturers will not be tolerated.[7]"
