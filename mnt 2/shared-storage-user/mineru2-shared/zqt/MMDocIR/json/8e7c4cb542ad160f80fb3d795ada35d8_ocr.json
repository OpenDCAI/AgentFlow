The most recent such attempt was the Unified Bulk Program proposed by the New York City Department of City Planning (DCP)\\(^2\\) in 1999.

Market demand is one (if not the most) important signal about how likely it is that new capacity actually will be developed. To better understand whether the City's rezonings created new capacity in areas primed for growth, we look at three measures of demand prior to the rezonings: population growth, the number of new certificates of occupancy issued, and the rate of house price appreciation."

The implications of this finding are mixed. On the one hand, it might show that upzonings are not particularly targeted to areas seeing unusual population growth. On the other hand, given that the upzoned lots weren't particularly concentrated in high growth areas, it may suggest that many upzoned areas were appropriate targets for the City's economic development initiatives.

Downzoned lots were in areas that saw significantly less building activity, while contextual-only rezoned lots were in areas that had much higher rates of development than the City median. These findings have several important implications. The fact the upzonings took place in areas with average levels of development may signal that the upzonings will have to lead, rather than follow, the market. It may be appropriate for upzonings to try to channel growth into areas where the market has not yet signaled interest if, for example, the City believes infrastructure in those areas is underused, or if the City plans to upgrade infrastructure it believes was holding development back. On the other hand, it could be that the average development patterns in the areas with upzoned lots signals that the market isn't interested in the area for reasons that City initiatives won't cure."

This increase was offset, however, by an approximately 40 million square feet decrease in traditionally residential areas (areas that were already zoned for residential only uses in 2003). The 100 million square feet net gain, then, was effectively concentrated in areas that were rezoned from a commercial or manufacturing district to a mixed-use district. While permitting residential development in mixed-use areas is consistent with many planning principles and may be an attractive way for New York City to grow, not all zoning capacity in mixed use areas will be used for residential development. To the extent that City policymakers are depending on mixed-used districts to accommodate residential growth, it is important to recognize that the amount of residential space that actually will be built in those districts will depend in part upon how the different uses will compete for finite land area."

We will examine such questions as: What effects do the rezonings have on the amount and type of development activity? How do the rezonings affect property values? Are rezonings followed by changes in the demographics or other characteristics of the neighborhood?

Such coordination can be difficult without a bird's eye view of the cumulative effect of each of these individual rezonings, but we hope this comprehensive analysis of the 2003 to 2007 rezonings will spur new thinking about the kinds of questions that must be asked during each individual rezoning study. The Mayor recently announced new efforts to improve interagency coordination; those efforts could provide an opportunity for the City to approach rezonings through more of a multi-agency lens."

If an individual downzoning preserves one neighborhood's character, for example, it may either limit the City's growth, or shift the burden of accommodating the City's growth to some other neighborhood. Our finding that the demographics of contextual-only rezoned areas differ dramatically from those of upzoned areas raises many questions. As discussed above, there is no general agreement on whether it is good or bad for one's neighborhood to be upzoned or downzoned. However, the variation in the pattern of rezonings among communities with different socio-economic characteristics calls for a larger conversation about how the benefits and burdens of development should be shared across the City."
