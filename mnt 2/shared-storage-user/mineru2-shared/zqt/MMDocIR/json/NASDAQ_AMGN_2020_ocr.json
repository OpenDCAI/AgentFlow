To overcome this challenge, we are now developing drugs that can form connections between two or more proteins. Instead of operating on their own—as traditional medicines do—these drugs induce proximity between targeted proteins, clearing the way for powerful biological mechanisms to help get the job done. This opens up vast new possibilities to tackle diseases that currently have few, if any, good treatment options."

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all."

See Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party's varies across these markets.

This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta® on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration."

A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is \"highly similar\" to the original reference product. We expect that the adverse impact on our originator-product sales from biosimilar competition will reflect current trends and actual results given similar conditions. We also believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products get approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, leading to net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products, resulting in a greater impact on our products' sales. In the United States, companies have now launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. See also Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. Although we expect competitor biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage our global experience versus both branded and biosimilar competition."

Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures are intensified when our products are subject to competition, including from biosimilars."

A drug's inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay \\(100\\%\\) of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla®, Repatha® and Aimovig®, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position."

Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting international reference pricing (IRP) schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics; increasing transparency on drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of such policies include the previous Administration's November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute most favored nation (MFN) IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of these rules are being challenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented. The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear at this time."

With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies."

Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within such plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, and some components are disposable, which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously. This eliminates the otherwise costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility, ultimately increasing the speed at which a medicine can become available for patients. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing."

The relevance of demonstrating \"similarity\" is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because risk-benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators' products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator's data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form."

The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval."

False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false-claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim."

Patients who were already enrolled in studies continued to receive study drug, including through direct-to-patient shipments. For studies that had the potential for significant benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition and when site resources enabled new patients to be enrolled safely and monitored closely, we continued enrollment. For clinical trials experiencing uncertainty with regard to the trial sites' ability to ensure subject safety or data integrity at that time, we temporarily paused enrollment. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and providing investigational drug supply. To date, the majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed. Study enrollments were affected the most in the second quarter of 2020 and by the end of the year resumed to prepandemic levels, although COVID-19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future patient enrollment. We continuously monitor and reevaluate the status of studies, pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites' ability to ensure safety or data integrity. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply. In addition, our R&D organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including by (i) working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19 on patients, (ii) joining a public-private partnership between leading companies in our industry and U.S. government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and (iii) participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections."

Our ability to perform critical functions and maintain operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected as a result of such workforce restrictions, and the COVID-19-related support programs we have put into place for our staff, suppliers and customers have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations. Notwithstanding such support programs, the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the health and availability of our workforce, as well as those of the third parties on which we rely, could have an adverse effect on our business. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including transportation and supply chains, have adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, the efficiency of our business operations. Also, the transition of the majority of our workforce to a remote work environment in response to COVID-19, as well as that of our third-party service providers, have exacerbated certain risks to our business, including, but not limited to, those associated with an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cybersecurity attacks (including social engineering attacks), and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or our proprietary or confidential information. As the pandemic continues to progress, we have observed an increase in cybersecurity incidents, predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks, experienced by our third-party service providers. Further, government entities have also been the subject of cyberattacks. The EMA disclosed in December 2020 that it had been the subject of a cyberattack that targeted and accessed third-party documents relating to regulatory submissions, and that such documents were published on the internet (some of which were manipulated prior to publication). Such third-party and governmental incidents have created the risk of the loss of availability and/or control of information (including information related to our clinical trials) important to the operation of our business. See A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation. In the future, as the pandemic progresses and afterwards, we may experience significant adverse effects on our commercial and clinical manufacturing activities, our operations, and our cybersecurity, and our suppliers and vendors may also experience significant disruptions to their activities and operations on which we depend, as a result of these cybersecurity incidents."

These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees for the duration of the pandemic and have significantly reduced patient access to, and administration of, certain of our drugs. For example, Prolia® is a product requiring administration by a healthcare provider in doctors' offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID-19. The U.S. label for Prolia® instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia® to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive, including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider. Further, as a result of COVID-19, oncology patients, in consultation with their doctors, may be selecting less immunosuppressive therapies or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting, potentially adversely affecting certain of our products. Also, new patients are less likely to be diagnosed and/or to start therapeutics during the pandemic. Once the pandemic subsides, we anticipate there will be a substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate limited provider capacity, and this limited provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales following the opening up of various geographies and/or the end of the pandemic. Further, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities."

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs, such as the WHO's COVID-19 Technology Access Pool initiative, which provides an approach for sharing all intellectual property, information and clinical trial data necessary to enable generic drug manufacturing. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. Further, the challenges of the pandemic have resulted in the exploration of signification legislation to address the need to supply medicines to address COVID-19. Pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency in the United States in March 2020 under the Stafford Act, state and local governments may request access to discounted pricing for certain items related to the COVID-19 response. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act implements initiatives to provide advanced payments from Medicare to healthcare providers, clinics and physicians and to require Medicare plans to provide up to a 90-day supply of Part D drugs. However, despite such initiatives and government support, there may be adverse effects on the timing and collectability of our customer receivables as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in a significant increase in unemployment and underemployment which may continue after the pandemic. Such a significant increase in unemployment or other disruptions in the labor market have led to a substantial reduction in disposable income and, in the U.S., access to healthcare insurance, including reductions in the commercially insured population that has led to growth (and is expected to continue to lead to growth) in Medicaid enrollment, which has adversely affected our product sales. See Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Such reduction in healthcare insurance could be compounded by any full or partial repeal of the ACA by the U.S. Supreme Court. Further, globally, the substantial pressures placed on governmental and payor budgets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the projected governmental budget shortfalls caused by significantly reduced economic activity during and potentially after the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the long-term impact from the pressures on healthcare systems, may result in greater and continued downward price pressure on biopharmaceutical products and increased intensity of stakeholder negotiations across the biopharmaceutical value chain.

There was a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in the autumn of 2020 and winter of 2020-2021, resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue or reinstate border closures, impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover, study, develop and produce our product candidates and products, disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain, and prevent or discourage patients from seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products, we or our suppliers may elect to, or governments may require us or our suppliers to, allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, customer relationships and financial results. In the U.S., on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness. The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, including the production of COVID-19 vaccinations or related therapies, such as our agreement to contribute to the production of one of Lilly's potential COVID-19 antibody therapies, could also result in increased competition for, or reduced availability of, materials used in the manufacturing or distribution of our products. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships."

The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering. Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products, such as the EMA) and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. In December 2020, SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations for a discussion of the cyberattack on the EMA."

Our international business, including in China and emerging market countries, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls. For example, China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection, use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&D activities in China. Our applications to the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC) seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC.

While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. While various replacement reference rates have been proposed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted, and the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBOR-linked financial instruments. See Part IV, Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies—Recent accounting pronouncements.

Subsequently, in the fall of 2020, the House Oversight and Reform Committee released staff reports and held hearings with executives from six biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, about their companies' drug pricing practices. Also, between 2019 and 2020, a number of other Congressional committees held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug-pricing and payment policy. For example, in 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and/or D faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D. Additionally, in late 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index), includes a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government, and requires that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. We expect H.R. 3, or some similar proposed legislation, to be debated by Congress this year. Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing. Further, in mid-2020, the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of biopharmaceuticals for patients, including a MFN policy for Medicare Parts B and D, under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement payment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for certain Part B and Part D medicines. In September 2020, in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released a final rule to allow states (or other nonfederal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada. Currently, the rule is being challenged by litigation, however, should such litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation, this rule could allow the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen's products (including Otezla®), that could have a material adverse effect on Amgen's business. Further, in November 2020, also in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach. If implemented, the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia®, XGEVA®, KYPROLIS®, Neulasta®, Nplate®, EPOGEN® and Aranesp®) equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations. Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation of this MFN rule based on, among other things, procedural defects. Late in 2020, in the case filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization and others, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction preventing the rule from taking effect nationwide, pending the government's completion of required administrative procedures. The case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23, 2021. Another case, filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, was also stayed. Notwithstanding these stays, the MFN rule's approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches, remain of interest. Further, despite the change in Administration, we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals, including proposals similar to the MFN rule, for the foreseeable future."

CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. CMS issued guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy (Step Therapy) and lowered reimbursement rates for new Medicare Part B drugs. Further, HHS issued a final rule under Medicare Part D revising the regulations under the federal antikickback statute to encourage PBMs to use rebates received from biopharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce patient cost-sharing at the point of sale. Changes to the regulations will be phased-in beginning on March 22, 2021, with all changes effective as of January 1, 2023. However, there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome before such rule can be effectively implemented and it is unclear how PBMs will change their business practices in response. Furthermore, a trade association representing PBMs recently filed litigation challenging this HHS final rule. Given these uncertainties, it remains unclear when any anticipated benefits to patients will materialize. The incoming Administration also could develop and seek to advance a range of policy proposals that could impact U.S. federal reimbursement policy for drugs and biologics."

In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CMS uses bundled payment rates. Between 2018 and 2020, Sensipar® and Parsabiv®, our calcimimetics that are used in dialysis clinics, were eligible for temporary drug add-on payment adjustments (TDAPA) to the bundled rate. In November 2020, CMS released its final rule ending the TDAPA for calcimimetics and adjusting ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled rates on January 1, 2021 by $9.93 per dialysis treatment for calcimimetics, and we expect the sales of our calcimimetics to be materially adversely affected by this rule change. Additionally, CMS created a new mandatory payment model effective January 1, 2021 focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for ESRD patients that could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients, including reduction of the use of our ESAs. Further, back in November 2019, CMS announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing, but due to COVID-19, the start date of such programs has been pushed back to April 1, 2021. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. In 2016, CMS initiated the Oncology Care Model demonstration, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care, that has been extended by one year (to 2022) due to COVID-19. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in late 2019, CMS announced a request for information on the Oncology Care First model, a new voluntary model that builds on the Oncology Care Model. CMS recently finalized a rule that, starting January 1, 2023, unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient, such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price and/or Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients, it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient. This new policy, if implemented, would have significant implications for our ability to offer copay assistance programs."

Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For example, a California law, the constitutionality of which is currently being challenged, purports to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. California adopted a 2020-21 budget that incorporates international pricing into Medicaid supplemental rebate negotiations and allows its Medicaid program to seek federal approval to extend supplemental rebates to non-Medicaid populations. New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps, and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada.

With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial copay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS recently finalized a policy that could cause commercial payers to adopt copay accumulator adjustment programs more widely. Payers have sought, and will likely continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to Repatha® treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha® by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha® prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha® available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare and on December 31, 2019, we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha®. Despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may change formulary coverage for Repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha®. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha® sales."

The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019 and 2020, CVS and Express Scripts created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.

IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA's approval of Repatha® for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha® in France is limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following a national health technology assessment. While the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing, the assessment currently limits our efforts in France to expand Repatha® access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them.

Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products' reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock."

On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations."

The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA). A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all."

In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products."

In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as \"umbrella exclusivity\"). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA's Orange and Purple Books."

A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha® reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha® to reduce the risk of certain CV events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels."

Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label.

For example, Neulasta® is available as part of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, and our AutoTouch® reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini® single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates, including sotorasib, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta® Onpro® kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products."

These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico's electric grid and communications networks in the future. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. Puerto Rico and the rest of the world are facing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health and economic implications. Since March 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents. Our operations and employees have been exempted from the lockdown and curfew, but we cannot predict how long these orders will continue in effect and what impact these orders and the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future operations, and whether the Governor will issue future Executive Orders imposing stricter lockdown and curfew measures should COVID-19 cases rise in Puerto Rico. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales.

Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including a stay of debtor litigation. In 2017, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which is currently undergoing a privatization process of its transmission and distribution infrastructure. Under PROMESA, other Title III filings for additional government entities may occur, further complicating Puerto Rico's already uncertain fiscal stability. In June 2019, in response to legal challenges, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PROMESA and confirmed the constitutionality of the appointment process."

Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda.

The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us."

For example, near the end of March, we began to observe a decline in sales of Prolia®, as elderly patients, who are relatively more vulnerable to COVID-19, avoided doctors' offices. Demand has since recovered to varying degrees by product as local conditions improved in certain geographies that opened after an initial improvement in COVID-19 infection rates, allowing patients to resume receiving their treatments. During the second half of the year, our own efforts remain focused on assisting patients with improving their continuity of care to increase product access as compared to what they experienced during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Recently, higher rates of infection have been observed in certain geographies, including the United States and Europe, which may further restrict demand, similar to early phases of the pandemic. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility through at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions."

These unit demand increases were partially offset by declines in net selling prices for certain products, unit demand declines for mature brands that face biosimilar or generic competition and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline. We also expect increasing competition against our biosimilar products. Further, the first quarter historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part, due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for our pharmacy benefit products."

Nevertheless, given the increased intensity exiting 2020 and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we expect there could be intermittent disruptions in physician-patient interactions going forward, and thus we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 primarily due to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income."

Capital expenditures were $608 million, $618 million and $738 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We currently estimate 2021 spending on capital projects to be approximately $900 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates."

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen's management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen's management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020."

The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance, and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is \\(200\\%\\) of the performance units granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020."

In this regard, the Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued $3.4 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits including transfer pricing. Auditing the assessment of the technical merits and measurement of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits is challenging because they can be complex, highly judgmental, and based on interpretations of tax laws and regulations and application of those interpretations to the Company's facts and circumstances."

This new standard requires that lessees recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet, including leases classified as operating leases, and that they disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements. The FASB subsequently issued additional amendments to address issues arising from the implementation of the new lease standard. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019, using the modified-retrospective method, which provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption. We used the adoption date as our date of initial application, and thus, comparative-period financial information is not presented for periods prior to the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification."

If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination (including the assumption of an acquiree's liability arising from an acquisition it consummated prior to our acquisition) are recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date and remeasured at their fair values each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved. The resulting changes in fair values are recorded in earnings. In contrast, asset acquisitions are accounted for using a cost accumulation and allocation model. Under this model, the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with an asset acquisition are recorded when it is probable that they will occur and they can be reasonably estimated.

This new standard also requires that credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities be recorded as an allowance through net income rather than reducing the carrying amount under the former other-than-temporary-impairment model.

The new standard provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to current GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting. Specifically, a modification to transition to an alternative reference rate is treated as an event that does not require contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting treatment. Moreover, for all types of hedging relationships, an entity may change the reference rate without having to designate the hedging relationship. The standard is generally effective for all contract modifications made and hedging relationships evaluated through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to expand on the scope of the original March 2020 standard to include derivative instruments on discounting transactions. We are currently evaluating the impact that both standards will have on our consolidated financial statements."

The performance goals for the units granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which are accounted for as equity awards, are based on (i) Amgen's stockholder return compared with a comparator group of companies, which are considered market conditions and are therefore reflected in the grant date fair values of the units, and (ii) Amgen's stand-alone financial performance measures, which are considered performance conditions. The expense recognized for awards is based on the grant date fair value of a unit multiplied by the number of units expected to be earned with respect to the related performance conditions, net of estimated forfeitures. Depending on the outcome of these performance goals, a recipient may ultimately earn a number of units greater or less than the number of units granted. Shares of our common stock are issued on a one-for-one basis for each performance unit earned. In general, performance unit awards vest at the end of the performance period. The performance award program provides for accelerated or continued vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plan, including upon death, disability, a change in control and retirement of employees who meet certain service and/or age requirements. Performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are typically payable in shares only when and to the extent the underlying performance units vest and are issued to the recipient, including with respect to market and performance conditions that affect the number of performance units earned."

These investments are typically redeemable only through distributions upon liquidation of the underlying assets. As of December 31, 2020, unfunded additional commitments to be made for these investments during the next several years were not material.

Our equity investment in BeiGene is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGene by approximately $2.4 billion. This investment is accounted for by using the equity method of accounting, which requires us to identify and allocate amounts to the items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years."

We are not permitted to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval."

This lawsuit stems from Sandoz's submission of an application for FDA licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen's ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,063,182 (the '182 Patent), 8,163,522 (the '522 Patent), 7,915,225 (the '225 Patent), 8,119,605 (the '605 Patent) and 8,722,631 (the '631 Patent). By their complaint, Amgen and Roche seek an injunction to prohibit Sandoz from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents. All Sandoz defendants responded by denying infringement and/or asserting that the patents at issue are invalid. In August 2016, and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation, the New Jersey District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Sandoz from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale Sandoz's etanercept product. Sandoz's Erelzi™, a biosimilar to ENBREL, was approved by the FDA in August 2016."

(Bioepis). This lawsuit stems from Bioepis' submission of an application for FDA licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen's ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: the '182, '522, '225, '605 and '631 Patents. By their complaint, Amgen and Roche seek an injunction to prohibit Bioepis from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents. On August 5, 2019, Bioepis responded to the complaint, denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 9, 2020 and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation and court order of January 6, 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered a consent injunction that prohibits Bioepis from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the United States Bioepis' etanercept product. Amgen and Bioepis entered into an agreement with respect to an injunction regarding etanercept as set out in the New Jersey District Court's order of January 6, 2020. On January 15, 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered an order administratively staying the case pursuant to a joint request of Amgen and Bioepis."

(collectively, Sanofi) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron), addressing seven of our patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,563,698; 8,829,165 (the '165 Patent); 8,859,741 (the '741 Patent); 8,871,913; 8,871,914; 8,883,983; and 8,889,834. These patents describe and claim monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). By its complaints, Amgen seeks an injunction to prevent the infringing manufacture, use and sale of Sanofi and Regeneron's alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PCSK9. In January 2016, the Delaware District Court granted Amgen's motion to amend the complaint to add its affiliates, Amgen Manufacturing, Limited and Amgen USA Inc., as plaintiffs and to add the allegation that Sanofi and Regeneron's infringement of Amgen's patents is willful."

Sanofi and Regeneron filed an appeal of the judgment and the permanent injunction to the Federal Circuit Court. In February 2017, following a motion by Sanofi and Regeneron, the Federal Circuit Court entered a stay of the permanent injunction during the pendency of the appeal. In October 2017, the Federal Circuit Court reversed in part the judgment of the Delaware District Court and remanded for a new trial two of the patent validity defenses (lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions), and affirmed the Delaware District Court's judgment of infringement of claims 2, 7, 9, 15, 19 and 29 of the '165 Patent and claim 7 of the '741 Patent and the third patent validity defense (finding that the claimed inventions were not obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the patents)."

In July 2018, Amgen filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Federal Circuit Court's conclusion that the judgment affirming the validity of Amgen's patents was based, in part, on an erroneous application of the law of written description. On January 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Amgen's petition for certiorari. On remand, the Delaware District Court scheduled a new trial on Sanofi and Regeneron's challenges to the validity of our patents based on lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions.

The Delaware District Court also ruled as a matter of law that claims 19 and 29 of the '165 Patent and claim 7 of the '741 Patent are invalid for failing to meet the enablement requirement, overturning the jury verdict.

This lawsuit stems from Pfizer's submission of an application for FDA licensure of a pegfilgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen's Neulasta®. Amgen has asserted infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707 (the '707 Patent) and seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief to prohibit Pfizer from infringing the '707 Patent. On March 4, 2020, Pfizer filed a motion requesting the Delaware District Court to dismiss the complaint by Amgen alleging noninfringement of the '707 Patent. In June 2020, the FDA approved Pfizer's NYVEPPIATM, a biosimilar to Amgen's Neulasta®."

(Alder) related to eptinezumab, an expected direct competitor to Aimovig and entrant in the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-related migraine therapy market. Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Also on April 4, 2019, Novartis initiated a separate lawsuit against Amgen in the same court seeking declaratory judgment that Novartis, alternatively, did not materially breach the collaboration agreements or, even if it did breach the collaboration agreements, such breach was not material and has been cured, and that Amgen may not terminate the collaboration agreements. On April 8, 2019, Amgen answered Novartis' complaint and filed counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that Novartis materially breached the collaboration agreements due to its affiliate Sandoz GmbH entering into the contract manufacturing agreement with Alder. In its counterclaim, Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. On July 16, 2019, Novartis filed an amended complaint adding a claim for breach of contract alleging Novartis is owed amounts associated with 2018 budget overruns and Amgen responded with a counterclaim alleging additional breaches by Novartis of the collaboration agreements. On September 17, 2019 and October 8, 2019, Novartis and Amgen, respectively, each filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings. On February 3, 2020, Amgen was granted leave to file its amended counterclaims. On February 4, 2020, Amgen filed its amended answer to Novartis' first amended complaint and second amended counterclaims for affirmative relief to add a fraudulent inducement claim. On February 18, 2020, Novartis filed its answer and affirmative defenses to Amgen's second amended counterclaims."

Amgen Inc., et al (April 10, 2019) (KPH). Each of the lawsuits is brought on behalf of a putative class of direct or indirect purchasers of Sensipar® and alleges that the plaintiffs have overpaid for Sensipar® as a result of Amgen's conduct that allegedly improperly delayed market entry by manufacturers of generic cinacalcet products. The lawsuits focus predominantly on the settlement among Amgen, Watson and Teva of the parties' patent infringement litigation. Each of the lawsuits seeks, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief and attorneys' fees and costs. On April 10, 2019, the plaintiff in the KPH lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits consolidated and designated as a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court, and the plaintiff in the Local 1500 lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits, along with Cipla Ltd. v.

In each case, the plaintiffs specifically allege that AbbVie has unlawfully monopolized the alleged market for Humira® and biosimilars of Humira®, including by creating an allegedly unlawful so-called patent thicket around Humira®. In the Local 1500, Sheet Metal Workers' and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs further allege that AbbVie entered into allegedly unlawful market division agreements with Amgen and other companies that had developed Humira® biosimilars, including Bioepis, Mylan, Sandoz, Inc., Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Pfizer Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in connection with the settlement of patent litigation relating to Humira®, whereby Amgen and the other defendants that have developed Humira® biosimilars were permitted to market those products in Europe as early as October 2018, while remaining off the market in the United States until 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions other than the Local 1500 and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs allege that AbbVie and Amgen entered into an allegedly unlawful settlement agreement under which Amgen allegedly agreed to delay its entry into the U.S. market with AMGEVITA™ (adalimumab), its Humira® biosimilar, in exchange for an alleged promise of exclusivity as the sole Humira® biosimilar in that market for five months, beginning in January 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorney's fees on behalf of a putative class of third-party payers and/or consumers that have indirectly purchased, paid for or provided reimbursement for Humira® in the United States. Defendants' responses to the first six complaints were stayed by the court. On June 4, 2019, the Illinois Northern District Court entered an order consolidating the twelve purported class action cases for pre-trial purposes."
