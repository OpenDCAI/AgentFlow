The survey also finds that while Republicans and Democrats both have negative views of China and are critical of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, this criticism is more prevalent among Republicans. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are significantly more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to have a very unfavorable view of China, to criticize the Chinese government's role in the global pandemic, and they often want to take a tougher policy approach to the country.
