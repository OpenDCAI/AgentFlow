At one point in the pandemic, India led the world in both COVID-19 cases and deaths. Yet, India is also a leading producer of vaccines, while several SCA countries export much needed personal protective equipment. State and USAID will work through regional diplomatic platforms such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), the C5+1 (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the United States), and the Economic Partnership Group (India, Israel, United Arab Emirates, and the United States) to strengthen regional and global cooperation to tackle the world's biggest challenges."

Some SCA countries have experienced increasing intolerance to religious freedom and marginalization of minority faith communities. There have also been increasing restrictions and decreasing protections on media freedom in several SCA countries. In some parts of our region, beginning in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic also exacerbated an erosion of civil liberties. According to the 2021 Freedom of the World Report, three countries in the region have become less free, and none of the SCA countries are currently rated as \"Free.\" Half of the countries in the region are listed as \"Not Free,\" highlighting democratic challenges within SCA. The United States is also concerned about the regression of women's, girls', and minority rights in Afghanistan and other countries. To counter regional illiberalism, SCA and Asia Bureaus will support civil society, independent media, judicial reform, a rules-based order, transparency, and accountability to defend against authoritarianism and corruption."

Most immediately, countries bordering Afghanistan – Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan – may bear the brunt of violent extremism or counterterrorist threats and have to manage an influx of refugees. Additionally, terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan, including Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba continue to have the ability to conduct attacks in the region.

This requires the United States to strengthen and enhance cooperation with our regional diplomatic frameworks such as the Quad, C5+1, and Indo-Pacific partners. A regional approach also warrants enhanced cooperation with international organizations, such as UN agencies, multilateral development banks, and regional institutions, including the Indian Ocean Rim Association."

Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only remaining countries with wild polio virus. India has the world's highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB) accounting for more than a quarter of the global TB burden, and the largest burden of multi-drug-resistant TB. Region-wide, non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This puts an enormous burden on health care financing and lost labor participation. Furthermore, the humanitarian and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have deepened challenges to alleviating poverty; improving food security; advancing gender equality; building prosperity; attracting investment; ensuring domestic security and stability; advancing political and socioeconomic reforms; and strengthening democratic structures. Neither South Asia nor Central Asia have regional organizations to build regional capacity, information sharing, epidemiological surveillance, convergence of regulations, or other public health functions. Gaps are filled to some extent by the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional offices covering South Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Central Asia. But there is no routine or formal system to exchange epidemiological data within or across sub-regions. As a result of this dearth of appropriate institutions/mechanisms, a regional approach remains challenging despite progress in the pharmaceuticals regulatory domain at the regional level in South Asia. The USG will encourage organizations (such as the WHO) and others with regional offices to strengthen information sharing. State and USAID will also work to strengthen existing regional platforms (C5+1 and CDRI), as well as increase multilateral and bilateral engagement with SCA to increase public health capacity in the region, to strengthen the region's resilience, and to mitigate the risks associated with both the pandemic and weakened health infrastructure. Only with progress along these tracks will SCA be able to rebound from losses in other sectors."

Addressing the climate crisis is a national security and foreign policy priority for the United States as outlined in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance; the Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad; and the 2022-2026 Joint Strategic Plan Objectives 1.2, 2.2, and 2.3. SCA countries are some of the most vulnerable to impacts of climate change; face increased water shortages; ocean acidification; sea-level rise; loss of habitats and environmental destruction; increased exposure to zoonotic diseases and pathogens; climate-driven migration; food insecurity, lack of resilient infrastructure; and risks of conflict. The World Bank estimates climate change will push 40 million people in South Asia to migrate within their own countries by 2050 from areas with lower water availability and crop productivity, including those affected by rising sea levels and storm surges. SCA countries are also grappling with how to promote sustainable economic development without exacerbating these vulnerabilities. Rapid population growth and development are driving increased demand for energy, water, food, and transportation, thereby increasing both carbon emissions and air pollution and reducing available water supplies. The region is home to the world's third largest greenhouse gas emitter. It also has both large producers and growing consumers of fossil fuels, so mitigation measures must accompany adaptation measures to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Consistent with the United States' priority of tackling the climate crisis and because climate impacts respect no national borders, the United States will work with SCA countries and institutions, bilaterally and multilaterally such as through C5+1 and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CRDI), as well as with the private sector, to strengthen capacity and mobilize resources to accelerate implementation of climate adaptation, resilience, and mitigation measures across sectors from climate-smart agriculture to clean energy deployment."

As such, strengthening SCA partner capacity to be resilient to national, regional, and international crises (such as the coronavirus pandemic or the impacts of climate change) and humanitarian crises (such as acute, life-threatening food insecurity to over 23 million Afghans and the influx of Afghans to neighboring countries in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover) are essential to support their timely and critical assistance to not only prepare, but also to prevent, mitigate and reduce the negative impacts of natural and manmade disasters, as well as humanitarian crises in the region."

Another 5.5 million people are internally displaced inside Afghanistan. Many Afghan refugees have lived in Pakistan for nearly 40 years, making it one of the largest and most protracted refugee populations in the world. The Government of Burma should create conditions that enable the safe, dignified, and voluntary return of Rohingya refugees. Until that occurs, it is in the United States' interests – and a reflection of our core values – to provide urgent, life-saving humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh. With the Taliban's ascension to power in Afghanistan, over an estimated 116,000 Afghans have fled to neighboring countries, placing an additional burden on host-country communities. It is also in the United States' interest to assist the SCA host countries and their impacted communities whose livelihoods, services, and natural environments have been negatively affected by the sudden and large population influx. The United States must work with partners in the region to support the basic needs of refugees, so that they can peacefully co-exist with host-country communities for the duration of their stay and resist dangers of radicalization to violence. Disasters and crises exacerbate gender inequalities, affecting women and girls. Women experience higher loss of life and greater loss of resources including livelihoods, education, health, security, among other areas and are at greater risk of sexual exploitation, gender-based violence, and abuse."

Central Asia, in contrast, is home to the region's most oppressive governing systems, with little space for criticism or opposition. SCA ranks second lowest globally on political stability, control of corruption, government effectiveness, and the rule of law.\\(^{2}\\) Entrenched corruption is pervasive in many SCA countries, which impedes democratic progress and is exploited by actors – either foreign powers or extremist elements – for political gains. Many SCA countries are dependent on regional powers such as Russia, People's Republic of China, and India for security, economic growth, and maintaining the political status-quo. Citizens of SCA experience limited human rights and civil freedoms, and many religious and racial minorities are marginalized, exploited, and often oppressed. The region is also host to some of the most globally challenging environments for women (Afghanistan) and other minority groups such as LGBTQI+ (Central Asia)."

These factors present significant risks to democracy in the region. Weak governance and a lack of rights-based rule of law erode the social contract between citizens and their governments, and can lead to instability, rise in extremism, and contribute to economic decline. The aftermath of the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan will have spillover effects across the region and are expected to exacerbate the risks to democracy, human rights, and good governance in neighboring countries. In addition, the U.S. government's moral authority in combating corruption has been severely degraded in the region by the legacy of corrupt practices associated with the former Afghan government. Similarly, the United States' history of domestic racial discrimination, lack of political inclusion, and shortage of equitable justice puts into question U.S. credibility in promoting democracy and undermines the concept of democracy as a system worth replicating. These dynamics are skillfully exploited by regional competitors, including the Russian government and the People's Republic of China."

Civil society also serves as a conduit between those governing and those governed, advocates for communities, provide crucial services where governments lack capacity; and provide governments with data and expertise to develop and implement effective policy and services. Media organizations report on issues of public interest and in so doing shape public opinion on critical issues of governance and social values, encourage dissent, and mitigate censorship and self-censorship. Across the region, media and civil society organizations play a crucial role in balancing the information landscape and countering disinformation used to discredit democratic processes, institutions, and values.

The World Bank also estimates that in South Asia only 23.6 percent of women participate in the workforce versus 80 percent for men. The lack of representation of girls in education and the workforce hinders their ability to fully participate in a democratic society. Equal rights for all members of society, regardless of socio-economic background, religious affiliation, sect, sexual orientation, gender, or ethnicity are essential for democracy to flourish. Inclusive and respectful governing systems are more inclined to ensure an equitable distribution of wealth, equal access to civil services, and opportunities for broad sweeping political participation. Democratic societies that fail to include women, minorities, and other marginalized groups in governance, either inadvertently or by design, struggle to achieve their full potential. Protections must be in place to prevent the ruling elites from dominating and infringing upon civil rights, while guaranteeing equitable access and inclusive participation. Governments must similarly nurture environments free of threats and intimidation that enable effective advocacy for the rights of women, marginalized and underrepresented groups, while ensuring the safety and protection of activists."

In South and Central Asia, the greatest threats to democracy and human rights are resurgent authoritarianism and spreading extremism, both of which can give states justification to use force, intimidation, and coercion to suppress individual freedoms in the name of security. Domestic and foreign power brokers also exploit cultural and ethnic divisions within societies for political ends, further challenging community cohesion. In some regions, radical interpretation of policy and expressions of religious, cultural, and ethnic identity further divide communities and promote exclusivity, often at the expense of marginalized or underrepresented groups."

Mindful of risks, U.S. advocacy for underrepresented groups must be conducted in a conscientious manner that neither discourages political backlash nor increases the vulnerability of the very groups it seeks to protect. Efforts will support human rights defenders and activists committed to the protection of marginalized individuals across the region.

When freely and fairly executed, they provide expansive political participation, reduce the likelihood of political violence, and build confidence in governance by effectively addressing public interests. Free and fair elections, however, are only one of the many inter-connected government and societal institutions necessary to sustain a dynamic democratic culture. These include vibrant civil society, an independent judiciary, free media, and opportunity for broad participation in an inclusive political process. U.S support for democratic development in the region aims to bolster the capacity and resilience of these vital institutions of democratic governance and ensure their ability to withstand foreign and domestic challenges to their operations. This objective supports JSP Strategic Objective 3.1: Democracy & Governance (Joint), as well as goals emphasized in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance. It also supports the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Central Asia Strategy, which seek to defend democratic institutions."

Rapidly expanding markets in SCA present an opportunity for equitable economic development through sustained, private sector-led growth. Actions to ensure reliable, affordable clean energy access for SCA countries as they develop momentum around transitioning to clean energy sources will also support sustainable and environmentally conscious economic growth in SCA and the United States. Increased access to markets, fair and transparent regulatory frameworks, an enabling environment conducive to investment, regional connectivity and cross-border trade, and increased labor force participation, particularly among women and marginalized communities who have historically experienced market exclusion, will support increased prosperity through private sector-led growth. South Asia lacks strong regional organizations dedicated to political and economic cooperation and therefore lags in intra-regional integration. Central Asia also lacks significant indigenous regional organizations dedicated to regional cooperation, though there is increasing cooperation through the C5+1 platform. Some nascent sub-regional organizations in South Asia also hold promise and could be further developed. Organizations like IORA support women's economic empowerment in South Asia, and the mandates for BIMSTEC and SAARC mandate include economic cooperation and other regional priorities."

Ongoing territorial disputes are common, with disagreements breaking out into outright armed conflict on an episodic basis. As a result, most SCA economies conduct the majority of their trade with countries outside the region. For example, the United States is India's biggest trading partner, while Indian trade with neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh is minimal. The World Bank estimates potential intra-regional trade in South Asia is \\(67 billion USD versus the current actual trade of \\)23 billion USD, and the gap is growing every year. This shortfall makes it difficult to address other problems facing the region, including poverty (33 percent of the world's poor reside in South Asia), and child nutrition (40 percent of the world's stunted children). USAID's South Asia Regional Initiative engages the South Asian bilateral governments, and regional BIMSTEC and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), to advance regional energy integration and cross-border electricity trade."

Climate impacts in SCA, such as high levels of air pollution from automobile combustion and flooding from rising sea levels, create social and economic costs, including negative health effects for people and stalled economic activity. However, multiple SCA countries have strong potential for renewable energy generation and have updated their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to include an increase in the utilization of renewable energy as a means to increase their climate ambitions and contribution to limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, SCA countries will need increasing access to innovative, decarbonized energy systems. U.S. companies are at the forefront of clean energy technology innovations and can provide solutions to the increased clean energy demand center of SCA, which will have both climate-related and economic benefits for SCA and the United States.

The necessity of transitioning from fossil fuels as a primary energy source to renewables is increasingly clear as global warming's impacts disrupt traditional livelihoods and natural ecosystems that sustain all living beings' survival. This is a critical moment for U.S. companies to gain market share in renewable and clean energy technologies which will continue to experience increased global demand in the upcoming decades. The United States' global competitors, including the PRC, are also potential suppliers of renewable and clean energy technologies. Thus supporting U.S. competitiveness in this sector will be critical for sustainable, clean energy generation; economic competitiveness in the growing clean energy field; and U.S. national security by ensuring that the United States does not lose leverage over the production of sensitive technologies to its strategic competitors."

It is critical for the U.S. to invest in security cooperation and rights-based security sector reform, strengthening the capacity of SCA partner countries to counter the threats from non-state actors. Al-Qaeda remains present in SCA, while Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) is increasing attacks in Taliban-governed Afghanistan and may in the near future pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. Meanwhile, the growing presence of Islamic State affiliates throughout SCA presents an enduring challenge. The United States remains committed to collaborating with our SCA partners to prevent and counter threats from non-state actors and to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a launching pad for international terrorism from groups such as AQIS and LeT and to ensure violence from Afghanistan does not spillover to neighboring countries. Threats against minority communities throughout the region are often inadequately addressed by majoritarian governments, and some violent extremist organizations (VEOs) or ethnonationalist groups exploit those gaps. At the same time, the United States will center a rights-based approach to ensure that the tools and capabilities provided to SCA partners and allies are focused against legitimate threats, and not deployed against peaceful protesters, journalists, or other actors who do not present a threat. This objective supports the security priorities of the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, Indo-Pacific Strategy, and Central Asia Strategy's security objectives."

Furthermore, addressing gender inequalities and supporting marginalized populations in India is an important step towards achieving inclusive development and prosperity. Currently, low and declining levels of women in the labor force; low levels of women's leadership; restrictive cultural norms; and high levels of gender-based violence are significant barriers to equality.

It is further possible that a slow economic recovery from COVID could lead to increased economic inequality and hamper objectives related to human rights and women's economic empowerment. Moreover, increasing regulation of digital technology and expression challenges civil society, media, and democratic institutions, while growing nationalism and religious intolerance create risks to internal stability. Instability in Afghanistan could create further challenges, such as an increase in violent extremism or a refugee crisis."

The PRC has rapidly become more assertive, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. It is the only competitor capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system globally and in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing has invested heavily in efforts meant to check U.S. strengths and prevent us from defending our interests and allies around the world. As state and non-state actors pose an increasing threat to security, cybersecurity, and infrastructure, we must work with India to improve our ability to secure and defend our interconnected networks, systems, and critical infrastructure."

Moreover, there is a risk of ineffective implementation of laws, policies, regulations, or standards developed to promote open, interoperable, reliable and secure digital infrastructure in India. Furthermore, terrorist and radicalization threats increasing or shifting with the changing environment in Afghanistan would pose challenges and risk to this objective. India also lacks a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), thereby lacking a clear approach or commitment to WPS which has strong negative implications for India's overall security and defense capacity domestically and in the Indo-Pacific region. To mitigate these risks, the U.S. will focus on prioritizing strong partnerships, such as the Quad, with India to accomplish the strengthening of its defense capacity."

High tariffs, subsidies, localization policies, restrictions on foreign investment, and concerns over intellectual property rights are impediments to full development of the U.S.-India trade relationship. India has the highest tariffs of any major economy and has long been one of the most protected. The United States withdrew India's GSP eligibility in 2019 due to India's failure to provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. Moreover, recovery from the pandemic has slowed economic growth and increased economic inequality among women and marginalized communities, which poses risk to any initiative to drive improvements in regional economic development. In India, pre-pandemic, female labor force participation rates had been declining for more than a decade, hovering around 27 percent, well below global norms. According to the World Bank, if even half of Indian women were in the labor force, the annual pace of economic growth would rise by 1.5 percentage points. Low levels of women's labor force participation across the country poses risk to successful, equitable, and sustainable economic development directly, and indirectly, impacts on community development and national security. Until hurdles related to women's workforce participation are addressed, supply chain diversification will be at risk. Furthermore, climate change threatens efforts to improve infrastructure, human capital, and economic development generally."

Keeping in reach the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Instability in energy markets, political dynamics, slower than anticipated economic recovery, and inability to access the level of technical and financial resources needed can hinder India's ability to pursue ambitious climate action at home and abroad. Without India's continued and elevated climate leadership on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing innovative clean energy and adaptation solutions, global efforts to halt the worst impacts of climate change will fall short."
