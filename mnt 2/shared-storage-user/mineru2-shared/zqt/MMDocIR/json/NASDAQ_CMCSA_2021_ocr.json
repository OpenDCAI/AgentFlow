We license films, including titles following the theatrical release window and selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers, including the Cable Communications and Sky segments. We also distribute films globally by selling them on DVDs and through digital distribution services."

In addition, it eliminated its prior \"net neutrality\" rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content on the internet; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (\"throttling\"); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate (\"paid or affiliated prioritization\"); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disavantaging consumers' ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disavantaging edge providers' ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to consumers (\"general conduct standard\"). The FCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), and it expressly preempted all state Open Internet laws. In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.

While the order was upheld by a federal appellate court, that decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, several localities have attempted, generally unsuccessfully to date, to impose franchise fees on DTC streaming and other OTT service providers."

The FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services such as ours should be classified as an \"information service\" or a \"telecommunications service\" under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. One federal court of appeals in the 8th Circuit has held that VoIP is an information service and preempted state regulation of VoIP, and the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review that determination, but that ruling remains limited to the seven states located in that circuit. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level."

The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock."

We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels."

Moreover, while Sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, it would adversely affect Sky's ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky's businesses and results of operations."

Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky's businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom's recent withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as \"Brexit\"), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected."

Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (\"MDUs\"), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our HD video or DVR services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers' accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in certain temporary COVID-19 programs, including an Internet Essentials promotion for new qualifying customers to receive 60 days of free broadband services. This 60-day free Internet Essentials promotional offer ended at the end of December 2021. Customers under this program are excluded from our customer metrics until they begin paying for their service. Total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology, resulting in a reduction of approximately 26,000 customers. There was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented have been recast on a comparable basis."

Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses."

Customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of Sky's four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. Sky reports business customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. In the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in Italy and Germany, which are counted as described above, consistent with the methodology for customers in the United Kingdom. Previously, customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in Italy or the number of active venues or rooms in Germany. This change resulted in a reduction in Sky's total customer relationships of 714,000 as of December 31, 2020. The impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. For comparative purposes, we have updated Sky's historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment."

Customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in Italy were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany. The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy."

The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance were substantially complete in 2021 and the substantial majority of the related costs savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses as of the end of 2021.

It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies."

The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes."

These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends."

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period."

The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services. Significant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are combined in a bundle. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and wireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize revenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. We also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are generally the sales agent in these arrangements and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within broadband revenue."

As part of distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to multichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized when services are provided."

Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.

Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee's net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee's net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends or other distributions received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee's net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to other income (loss), net. Cash distributions received from equity method investments are considered returns on investment and presented within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows to the extent of cumulative equity in net income of the investee. Additional distributions are presented as investing activities. Distributions presented within operating activities totaled $1.1 billion, $66 million and $215 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively."

We apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to a majority of our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations.

We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value.

The interest rate on a Loan denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate (\"LIBOR\") is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") publicly announced that: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of all seven euro LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after December 31, 2021, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to consultation by the FCA, be provided on a changed methodology (or \"synthetic\") basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored; and immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA's consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments. Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, a Term ESTR Transition Event, a Term TONA Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 3.03(b) and (c) provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 3.03(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Floating Rate Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to LIBOR or other rates in the definition of \"LIBO Rate\" (or \"EURIBOR Rate\", or \"TIBOR Rate\", as applicable) or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 3.03(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, a Term ESTR Transition Event, a Term TONA Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.03(d)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate (or the EURIBOR Rate, or the TIBOR Rate, as applicable) or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as applicable) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability."
