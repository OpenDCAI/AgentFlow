Since then, the Constitution has been amended four times: in 2007 (twice), 2012, and 2018. The Constitution of 1999 clarified that Finland is bound by international treaties pertaining to human rights, including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In addition, Finland is a member of the European Union (EU) and bound by the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Both the ECHR and the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union include rights that are also found in Finland's Constitution. Thus, decisions about what constitutes a constitutionally protected right are made by Finland's Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and the European Court of Justice."

For example, Finland has lost cases before the ECtHR for punishing speech too harshly, including with prison sentences.[41] In Nikula v. Finland, the Court found that the conviction of Anne Nikula, a lawyer convicted for defamation for criticizing a prosecutor for a decision in a criminal proceeding in which the lawyer was representing one of the defendants, violated Article 10 of the Convention. According to the ECtHR, the restriction on the lawyer's freedom of speech had a potential chilling effect and there was a lack of \"pressing social need.\"[42]"

The photographer had not been prevented from reporting on the event, and disobeyed the police's order by staying with the demonstrators, who had been ordered to disperse, instead of reporting from a designated press area. Because it was unclear whether the photographer had identified himself properly as a member of the press and because the photographer was convicted without penalty, the ECtHR (Grand Chamber) found there had been a \"fair balance\" of competing interests and, thus, no violation of the Convention.[47]"

For example, in a 2018 decision, Finland's Supreme Court found that the publication on Facebook of a picture of a man who was convicted of sexual assault of a child violated the right to privacy, resulting in monetary fines.[106] In a 2019 Supreme Court decision, the publication of a picture and name of a man together with a description of him as an internet snitch and protector of pedophiles, insinuating that the man himself was a pedophile, was deemed a violation of privacy and resulted in the issuance of daily fines.[107] In 2019, the Supreme Court held that a petitioner's right to request the deletion of allegedly unlawful materials online (under Section 23 of the Act on Freedom of Expression in Mass Communications) was independent of the prosecutor's decision to make such a request or to discontinue the investigation.[108] In \\( HD \\) 2009:3, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of a lower court in which a father and his acquaintance were convicted of disseminating information that violated personal privacy by publishing a video online showing his children being taken into custody by the social services.[109]"

In the case, a stranger posted a profile of a boy who was 12 years of age on a dating site but the boy had no criminal law remedy against the offender.[113] In I. v.
