Refer to Annex 1 for a list of modules offered by ISEP. \nImportant note: \n• All modules taken should be level 5000 or 6000.\n• Levels 1000 - 4000 are undergraduate modules and can only be read as &quot;AUDIT&quot;. Students who audit a module will not receive a final grade. Audited modules will not appear on the student&#x27;s transcript / result slip. No record of attendance will be issued to auditors of a module. Note that it is subject to the host Faculty&#x27;s approval whether students are allowed to audit a module.\n• Graduate Modules Classified as S/U\n1. This is applicable to all ISEP students who wish to take graduate modules outside their main undergraduate discipline, to be graded on a S/U system and NOT count towards the CAP.\n2. Student may request for up to 3 modules (12 MCs), with the support of your main supervisor.\n3. Application for S/U modules has to be done within the first month of the start of the module. Once approved by ISEP and the department hosting the module, students are not allowed to reverse their decision, be it before the examination or after the examination results release.\n4. Any request for changes to the modules after the examination results release such as changing grading basis from S to grade, grade to S/U or deleting a module is NOT allowed. \nNOTE: The &#x27;S&#x27; or &#x27;U&#x27; grade has no effect on the CAP since they carry no grade point. The modular credits earned with an &#x27;S&#x27; grade will count towards the total number of modular credits that a student needs to fulfil his degree programme. On the contrary, a module with an &#x27;U&#x27; grade earns no modular credits.\nIn other words, another module which carries the same modular credit needs to be taken to compensate for the &quot;U&quot; graded module, and it should be noted that the limit of three S/U declarations for electives taken by the candidate cannot be exceeded.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Lab rotations</td><td></td><td>All new students have to complete two laboratory rotations (LRs) with two ISEP-approved supervisors within the first 4 months of their candidature.

Students shall be introduced to the school's academic structure, aspirations and expectations, with advice from faculty research directors and prominent ISEP alumni in a workshop. Students shall be coached on their academic writing and presentation skills. They shall engage in in-depth research discussions and learn how to conduct a scientific dialogue, and to make impressive presentations at meetings and conference. Students shall be lectured by university experts on the process of scientific publication, as well as to intellectual property and patent issues. The within-discipline and cross-discipline journal club components shall provide intense training in scientific assessment and critique on topics within and outside a student's original discipline, at an advanced level with instructors and peers in a small group setting."
