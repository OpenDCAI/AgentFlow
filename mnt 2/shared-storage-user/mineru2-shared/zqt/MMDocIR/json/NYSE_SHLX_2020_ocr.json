As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (\"PPI-FG\"). The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. FERC's indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. As a result of its prior five-year review, FERC revised its indexing methodology and determined that, during the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG plus \\(1.23\\%\\). In May 2020, Zydeco, Mars, LOCAP and Colonial filed with FERC to increase rates subject to FERC's indexing adjustment methodology by approximately \\(2.0\\%\\) starting on July 1, 2020. FERC commenced the current five-year review of its indexing methodology in June 2020. FERC reviewed the pipeline cost changes over the past five years to set an adjustment to PPI-FG so that it reflects changes to costs industry-wide. After receiving comments and reply comments on its proposed order, FERC issued an order on December 17, 2020 setting the new methodology to PPI-FG plus \\(0.78\\%\\), effective July 1, 2021. FERC's order is subject to rehearsing and possible judicial review."

Some indexed rates on our systems were reduced in 2016 in response to the negative index lowering the ceiling, such as certain spot rates on Zydeco. Rate increases made under the index methodology are presumed to be just and reasonable and require a protesting party to demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline's increase in costs. Despite these procedural limits on challenging the indexing of rates, the overall rates are not entitled to any specific protection against rate challenges. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling."

A common carrier can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. A common carrier can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers.

If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates on our different pipeline systems, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise. In 2005, FERC issued a policy statement stating that it would permit common carrier pipelines, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost-of-service rates to reflect the tax liability attributable to a regulated entity's operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC's policy, a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on the regulated entity's income. Whether a pipeline's owners have such income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although this policy is generally favorable for common carrier pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to FERC's case-by-case review approach and recent changes to FERC's policy following litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, as described below. The application of this policy, as well as any decision by FERC regarding our cost of service, is also subject to review in the courts."

FERC also stated that it would address income tax allowances for other \"pass-through\" entities that are not MLPs in future proceedings. On July 18, 2018, FERC clarified in Order No. 849, which was directed at gas pipelines, its general disallowance of MLP income tax allowance recovery by providing that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance based on a demonstration that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a \"double-recovery of investors' income tax costs.\" While FERC has not taken industry-wide action on oil pipeline rates, FERC could require oil pipelines to revise their rates in individual proceedings (including initial rate filing or complaint proceedings) or through other action. To the extent that we charge cost-of-service based rates, those rates could be affected by any changes in FERC's income tax allowance policy to the extent our rates are subject to complaint or challenge by FERC acting on its own initiative, or to the extent that we propose new cost-of-service rates or changes to our existing rates."

The HLPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to develop, prescribe, and enforce federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Every four years PHMSA is up for reauthorization by Congress and with that reauthorization comes changes to the legislative requirements that Congress sets forth for the oversight of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. In 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (the \"Pipes Act\") was enacted. The Pipes Act reauthorized PHMSA through 2023 and imposed a few new mandates on the agency. The law establishes a PHMSA technology pilot, authorizes a new idled pipe operating status, contains process protections for operators during PHMSA enforcement proceedings and directs PHMSA to adopt regulations to address methane leaks from pipelines. There are no self-enacting portions of this act that impact our assets. We will be engaged in the regulatory process as PHMSA issues Reports and Notices of Proposed Rulemakings to meet the requirements set out in the Pipes Act.

The two rules impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extends the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond HCAs to pipelines in Moderate Consequence Areas (\"MCAs\"). It also includes requirements to reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure (\"MAOP\"), report MAOP exceedances, consider seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management and use certain safety features on in-line inspection equipment. The rule concerning hazardous liquids extends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events and adds a requirement to make all lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. There are new MCAs on some of our gas transmission lines; however, these lines are already fully inspected due to HCAs on the lines, so these new areas do not impact our inspection or maintenance programs on the lines. On the liquid side, all onshore lines have leak detection and are currently inspected under our Integrity Management Program, so there are no new inspections required. Some of our product lines may need to be made piggable; however, the full evaluations of those lines have not been completed to fully understand potential cost implications."

As with the industry in general, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities.

However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage or claims by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity if we do not recover these expenditures through the rates and fees we receive for our services.

President Biden has issued a series of Executive Orders seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise or rescind prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration's climate policies. Requiring reductions in GHG emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.

For example, in May 2016, EPA finalized new rules for volatile organic compound and methane emissions from the oil and gas production, processing, transmission and storage industry. In August 2020, the EPA issued two final rules that rescinded the methane-specific requirements of the rules applicable to sources in the production and processing segments and removed the transmission and storage segment from the source category. However, these 2020 rules are being challenged in the U.S. Circuit Court for the D.C. Circuit. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directing the EPA to consider rescinding or revising the 2020 rules and proposing new regulations to expand these rules for the oil and gas production, processing, transmission and storage industries. Congress continues to consider legislation on GHG emissions, which may include proposals to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs, although the ultimate adoption and form of any federal legislation cannot presently be predicted. In addition, in 2015 the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the United States in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, the U.S. State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and withdrew from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an instrument that reverses this withdrawal, and the United States will formally re-join the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021."

In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations that expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule was stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. In October 2019, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 regulations and reinstated the agencies' narrower pre-2015 scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. In April 2020, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a new final \"waters of the United States\" (\"WOTUS\") definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction than contemplated under the 2015 WOTUS definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. Judicial challenges to the EPA's October 2019 and April 2020 final rules are currently before multiple federal district courts. If the rules are vacated and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of Clean Water Act jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance, as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities."

Environmental groups had alleged that the Corps failed to consult with federal wildlife agencies as required by the Endangered Species Act. The court's decision vacated NWP 12 until the Corps completes consultation with the applicable federal wildlife agencies. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted in part and denied in part the Corps' request to stay the U.S. District Court's decision. The Supreme Court's decision allows the use of NWP 12 as to construction of new oil and gas pipelines, pending the outcome of the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and any subsequent petition for review to the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, in January 2021, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule reissuing and restricting NWP 12 to oil and gas pipelines. However, the NWP rulemaking is among the agency actions listed for review in accordance with the January 20, 2021 Executive Order: \"Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.\" Limitations on the use of NWP 12 may make it more difficult to permit our projects and could cause us to lose potential and current customers and limit our growth and revenue."

In June 2017, BOEM announced that it would extend the NTL implementation timeline beyond the initial June 30, 2017 deadline, except in circumstances where there is a substantial risk of non-performance of decommissioning obligations, citing that more time was needed to work with the industry and other interested parties. In February 2017, BOEM announced that it would withdraw the orders to allow time for the Trump Administration to review BOEM’s financial assurance program. In October 2020, BOEM published a proposed rulemaking to clarify and simplify its financial assurance requirements. The issuance of a final rule is uncertain under the Biden Administration."

On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In an effort to halt the outbreak, governments worldwide have placed significant restrictions on both domestic and international travel and have taken action to restrict the movement of people and suspend some business operations, ranging from targeted restrictions to full national lockdowns. The pandemic and resulting governmental responses have caused a significant slowdown in the global economy and financial markets. Concerns regarding increasing infection rates as countries and states move forward with reopening their economies has resulted in renewed lockdowns and other restrictions being imposed or a general slowdown of the reopening process in some of the affected areas and could be imposed in or affect other areas, which could lead to further economic instability and decreased demand for crude oil, refined products or refinery gas. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental response may continue to impact our business and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the disease (including the discovery of strains that are more transmissible or virulent), the efficacy and distribution"

On April 9, 2020, these countries announced supply cuts, which were extended through the end of July 2020, but such cuts have thus far been insufficient to counter all of the demand destruction in the oil and gas markets caused by the effects of COVID-19. After increasing supply through the summer of 2020, certain OPEC members announced production cuts in October 2020, potentially signaling continued pressure on demand. In January 2021, OPEC and certain other non-OPEC, oil-producing countries agreed to forgo any supply increases in February and March 2021 in response to continuing demand constraints in the oil and gas markets caused by renewed lockdowns and other global measures to curtail the rise of COVID-19 infections. The significant decline in worldwide demand for oil and gas resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects have resulted in dramatically decreased oil and gas prices, which could have substantial negative implications for our transportation revenue, allowance oil revenue and other sources of revenue related to or underpinned by commodity prices. As a result, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. At this point, we cannot accurately predict what effects current market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, which will depend on, among other factors, the duration of the continued outbreak and the effects of new viral strains, the extent of increased infection rates in response to economic re-openings, the efficacy and timely distributions of available vaccines and the extent and overall economic effects of the continuing governmental response to the pandemic, including any lockdowns, other restrictions or a general slowdown of the reopening process in the affected areas."

If any such event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we perform an impairment assessment by comparing estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's net book value. If the net book value exceeds our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is calculated as the amount the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value associated with the asset. Based on these updated evaluations, we determined that there is no impairment in property, plant and equipment, and equity method and other investments for 2020.

For example, Mars depends on a natural gas supply pipeline connecting to the West Delta 143 platform to power its equipment to deliver the volumes it transports to salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana. Similarly, shutdown or blockage of pipelines moving offshore gas can result in curtailment or shut-in of offshore crude production. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines, production platforms, refineries, caverns or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. For example, production platforms in the offshore Gulf of Mexico may be required to be shut-in by BSEE or BOEM of the U.S. Department of the Interior following incidents such as loss of well control. Additionally, due to continued macroenvironmental factors of depressed demand (due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting governmental response and other factors) and oversupply (due to sustained production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC, oil-producing countries that have been insufficient to fully counter the demand destruction of COVID-19 and other factors), certain pipelines and storage facilities may approach or reach maximum capacity, causing producers to shut-in production. If these or any other pipeline or terminal connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of crude oil or refined products due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity, shut-in by regulators or any other reason, or if caverns to which we connect have cracks, leaks or leaching or require shut-in due to regulatory action or changes in law, our ability to operate efficiently and continue to store or ship crude oil and refined products to major demand centers could be restricted, thereby reducing revenue. Disruptions at refineries that use our pipelines, such as strikes or ship channel incidents, can also have an adverse impact on the volume of products we ship. Increases in the rates charged by the interconnected pipelines for transportation to and from our terminal facilities may reduce the utilization of our terminals. Our refined products terminals are limited to a \\(5\\%\\) reduction in payments by the customer due to force majeure incidents. However, our customers and other counterparties may have other contractual defenses to performance available to them, including the doctrine of impossibility, impracticability of performance, frustration of performance and others, the use and success of which we cannot predict. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline or terminal interconnect, at any key production platform or refinery, at caverns to which we deliver, termination of any connection agreement or adverse change in the terms and conditions of service, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders."

Moreover, certain OPEC members announced production cuts in October 2020, potentially signaling continued pressure on demand. In January 2021, OPEC and certain other non-OPEC, oil-producing countries agreed to forgo any supply increases in February and March 2021 in response to continuing demand constraints in the oil and gas markets caused by renewed lockdowns and other global measures to curtail the rise of COVID-19 infections. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental responses worldwide have led to unprecedented demand destruction in the crude and finished products markets. These ongoing events and other current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty may contribute to further future volatility in financial and commodity markets in the near to medium term.

Although these countries reached an agreement on supply cuts in April 2020 and October 2020, and agreed to maintain these cuts for February and March 2021, such response has been insufficient to compensate for all of the demand destruction resulting from the effects of COVID-19. Further, concerns regarding increasing infection rates as countries and states move forward with reopening their economies has resulted in renewed lockdowns and other restrictions being imposed or a general slowdown of the reopening process in some of the affected areas and could be imposed in other areas, which could lead to further economic instability and decreased demand for crude oil, refined products or refinery gas. If the demand for crude oil, refined products or refinery gas continues to significantly decrease, or if there were a material increase in the price of crude oil supplied to our customers' refineries without an increase in the value of the products produced by those refineries, either temporary or permanent, it may cause our customers to reduce production of refined products at their refineries. If production of refined products declines, there would likely be a reduction in the volumes of crude oil and refined products that we transport. Moreover, if demand for oil and refined products further decreases substantially, certain of our pipelines and storage tanks may reach maximum capacity if these commodities and products cannot be sold into markets, which may result in a forced shut-in of certain producer sites.

The outcome of federal, state and regional actions to address climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations to control or restrict emissions, taxes or other charges to deter emissions of GHGs, energy efficiency requirements or alternative energy requirements to reduce demand, or other regulatory actions. These actions could result in increased compliance and operating costs or could adversely affect demand for the crude oil and refined products that we transport. Additionally, adoption of federal, state or regional requirements mandating a reduction in GHG emissions could have far-reaching impacts on the energy industry and the U.S. economy. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations."

These complaints have been consolidated by FERC in Docket Nos. OR18-7-002, et al. and were set for hearing and settlement judge procedures. FERC also severed the review of Colonial's market-based rates into a separate, concurrent hearing. On May 2, 2019, the Chief Administrative Law Judge terminated settlement judge procedures and established a procedural schedule for a hearing before an administrative law judge. The hearing took place in the latter part of 2020 and an initial decision from the administrative law judge is currently scheduled for August 2021, with a FERC decision anticipated by spring 2022. Since the consolidated complaint proceedings are ongoing, FERC has not taken any final action on the complaints and the outcome is not known at this time. If Colonial is unable to recover its full cost-of-service as a result of the rates established in this proceeding, is no longer able to charge market-based rates or has its procedures and charges related to transmix and product volume loss modified in a way that is adverse to Colonial, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders."

In the Revised Policy Statement, FERC states that it would address the effect of the tax changes on industry-wide oil pipeline costs in the five-year review of the oil pipeline index level, which commenced in 2020. As with the corporate income tax rate reduction, FERC also has announced that it would take the MLP income tax allowance elimination into account in the next five-year review of indexed rates in 2020. Both of these factors were considered as part of the order on the five-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the income tax allowance elimination in setting the new indexing adjustment. Separately, FERC also could require oil pipelines to revise their rates in individual proceedings (including initial rate filing or complaint proceedings) or through other action. Certain of our current tariff rates on file with FERC may reflect the federal income tax rate that was in effect at the time those tariff rates were established. As with any regulatory requirements promulgated by FERC, if FERC requires us to establish new tariff rates that reflect the current federal corporate income tax rate, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders."

This arrangement exposes us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when the crude oil is received from a ship or connecting carrier using different measurement techniques, or resulting from solids and water produced from the crude oil. It is not always possible for us to completely mitigate the measurement differential. If the measurement differential exceeds the loss allowance, the pipeline must make the customer whole for the difference in measured crude oil. Additionally, we take title to any excess product that we transport when product losses are within the allowed levels, and we sell that product several times per year at prevailing market prices. This allowance oil revenue is subject to more volatility than transportation revenue, as it is directly dependent on our measurement capability and prevailing commodity prices."

If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we may be unable to expand our business operations and may be unable to maintain or raise the level of our quarterly cash distributions. The entities in which we own an interest may also incur borrowings or access the capital markets to fund capital expenditures and may require that we fund our proportionate share of such expenditures. Our and their ability to obtain financing or access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at such time as well as the covenants in our debt agreements, general economic conditions and contingencies, or other uncertainties that are beyond our control. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by MLPs has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our capital expenditures and to fund acquisitions with the issuance of equity in the capital markets. Any further decline in the debt and equity capital markets may increase the cost of financing and the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, lenders are facing increasing pressure to curtail their lending activities to companies in the oil and natural gas industry. There can be no assurance that the capital markets or borrowings will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The terms of any financing or the availability of cash on hand could limit our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders. Incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional limited partner interests may result in significant common unitholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current distribution rate, which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions at the then-current distribution rate."

Disruptions in these processes could impact our ability to provide important information to our management, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business. In addition, we may experience periodic or prolonged disruption of our financial functions arising out of the implementation and conversion, general use of the ERP system, other periodic upgrades or updates or other external factors that are outside of our control. If any of these risks occur and have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to effectively complete our financial reporting process and prepare consolidated financial statements on a timely basis, and we may need to revise our controls or adopt new controls to prevent any deficiencies in our internal controls environment."

Withholding, the amount of which may be greater or less than a particular unitholders' income tax liability to the state, generally does not relieve a nonresident unitholder from the obligation to file an income tax return. Amounts withheld may be treated as if distributed to unitholders for purposes of determining the amounts distributed by us. It is each unitholder's responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns required by applicable law to be filed by such unitholder. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units. Prospective unitholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding such matters."

Similarly, we expect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to onshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars.

In addition to serving directly-connected U.S. Gulf Coast markets, our crude oil and refined products pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation and storage services for a variety of reasons. Refiners typically require a secure and reliable supply of crude oil over a prolonged period of time to meet the needs of their specified refining diet and frequently enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure a ready supply of crude oil, rate surety and sometimes sufficient transportation capacity over the life of the contract. Similarly, chemical sites require a secure and reliable supply of refinery gas to crackers and enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure steady supply. Producers of crude oil and natural gas require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greater market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil and refined products to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil and refined products supply and demand dynamics in our markets.

In Order No. 849, however, FERC has clarified its general disallowance of MLP income tax allowance recovery by providing that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance. FERC will permit an MLP to demonstrate that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a \"double recovery of investors' income tax costs.\" FERC affirmed Order No. 849 on rehearsing on April 18, 2019. Parties sought judicial review of the Revised Policy Statement, and that challenge, initially filed in March 2019, was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 14, 2020.

FERC proposed a new formula of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (\"PPI-FG\") plus \\(0.09\\%\\) based on its review of industry data provided in the annual FERC Form 6 reports from 2014 through 2019. The NOI proposal, which would take effect in July 2021, would change the current five-year formula from PPI-FG plus \\(1.23\\%\\). FERC invited comments regarding its proposal and any alternative methodologies for calculating the index level, including issues such as different data trimming methodologies and whether it should reflect the effects of any cost-of-service policy changes in the calculation of the index level. Comments on the NOI were filed by multiple parties by August 17, 2020, and reply comments were filed by September 11, 2020. After reviewing the comments and reply comments by interested parties, FERC issued an order on December 17, 2020 adopting a new formula of PPI-FG plus \\(0.78\\%\\) for the next five-year period commencing on July 1, 2021. This order is subject to rehearsing and possible judicial review."

Since FERC only maintains jurisdiction over interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the recent decisions are not expected to have an impact on rates charged through our offshore operations. FERC also does not maintain jurisdiction over certain of the onshore assets in which we have interests. Rates related to these assets should not be impacted by FERC's decision. For our FERC-regulated rates charged through our interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the rates are based on either a negotiated or market-based rate and are not set through cost-of-service ratemaking subject to FERC's approval, which are below the cost-of-service rates established by FERC. As such, neither our negotiated nor market-based rate revenue for our FERC-regulated assets would be subject to the income tax recovery disallowance. Additionally, we have evaluated the impact of FERC's recent policy changes on our non-operated joint ventures. Due to the nature of their assets, operations and/or their entity form, we do not believe there will be any material impact to their operations and earnings."

The rule concerning hazardous liquids extends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events and adds a requirement to make all onshore lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. There are new MCAs on some of our gas transmission lines; however, these lines are already fully inspected due to HCAs on the lines, so these new areas do not impact inspection or maintenance programs on the lines. On the liquids side, all onshore lines have leak detection and are currently inspected under our Integrity Management Program, so there are no new inspections required. Some of our product lines may need to be made piggable; however, the full evaluations of those lines have not been completed to understand potential cost implications."

Given the size and scope of Shell's footprint and its significant ownership interest in us, we expect acquisitions from Shell will be a growth mechanism for the foreseeable future. However, Shell and its affiliates are under no obligation to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will continue to focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and midstream assets. We believe that we would be well positioned to acquire midstream assets from Shell, as well as from third parties, should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or if we incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the acquisitions, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash. Our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may also directly impact our ability to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions. The level of current market demand for equity issued by MLPs may make it more challenging for us to fund our acquisitions with the issuance of equity in the capital markets. However, we believe our balance sheet offers us flexibility, providing us other financing options such as hybrid securities, purchases of common units by RDS and debt. While we expect to retain this flexibility, in 2021 we anticipate continuing to moderate inorganic growth in our asset base and focusing on the sustainable operation of our core assets, cash preservation and organic growth of our business."

We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations."

The common units were valued using a market approach based on the market opening price of the Partnership's common units as of April 1, 2020 less a discount for the distribution waiver and lack of marketability. The Series A Preferred Units were valued using an income approach based on a trinomial lattice model. Further, the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction were determined using an income approach of discounted cash flows at an average discount rate for each of the Mattox Transaction, the Norco Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components of \\(14\\%\\), \\(11\\%\\) and \\(20\\%\\), respectively."

The Partnership established the SASP for the service components using an expected cost-plus margin approach based on the Partnership's forecasted costs of satisfying the performance obligations plus an appropriate margin for the service. The SASP is used to allocate the annual terminaling service agreement payments between the principal payments and interest income on the financing receivables (financing components) and terminaling service revenue (service components). The key assumptions include forecasts of the future operation and maintenance costs and major maintenance costs and the expected margin with respect to the service components and the expected return on the assets with respect to the financing components."

In addition, using the related party listing obtained, we performed procedures to test material related party account activity and account balances including, among others, testing the related and third party classification of transactions in revenue, expense and balance sheet accounts by inspecting source documentation and evaluating the aggregation and presentation of related party financial statement line items.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Accounting for the April 2020 Transaction</td></tr><tr><td>Description of the \nMatter</td><td>As more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership purchased certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex (the “Norco Assets”) from Shell and entered into terminaling services agreements that leased the Norco Assets back to Shell (the “Norco Transaction”). Simultaneously with the closing of the Norco Transaction, the Partnership acquired 79% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox Pipeline Company LLC from Shell (the “Mattox Transaction), eliminated all of the incentive distribution rights, and converted the 2% economic general partner interest in the Partnership into a non-economic general partner interest (the “GP/IDR Restructuring”). As consideration for these transactions, the Partnership issued 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units and 160,000,000 common units to Shell. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the April 2020 Transaction.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Auditing the Partnership’s accounting for the April 2020 Transaction was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the Partnership’s determination of the contract assets of $244 million recorded in connection with the April 2020 Transaction, which was dependent on the fair values of the consideration transferred and of the Norco Transaction, Mattox Transaction and GP/IDR Restructuring that were entered into simultaneously. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the contract assets’ value to underlying assumptions used to fair value the components of the April 2020 Transaction. The Partnership used an income approach of discounted cash flows to estimate the fair values of the components. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the components primarily included the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of forecasted cash flows, including projected revenues, operating expenses and capital expenditures. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.</td></tr></table>"

If the seller-lessee transfers control of an asset to us, we account for the transfer of the asset as a purchase and recognize the transferred asset. The subsequent leaseback of the asset is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (the \"lease standard\"), in the same manner as any other lease. If the seller-lessee does not transfer the control of an asset to us, the failed sale-leaseback transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement. Transactions in which control of an asset is not transferred are accounted for as financing receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables. Since the seller-lessee did not transfer the control of assets to us in the April 2020 Transaction (defined in Note 3 — Acquisitions and Other Transactions below), we did not recognize the transferred assets, and instead they were accounted for as financing receivables. Receivables issued in exchange for the Partnership's capital stock are presented as a component of the partners' (deficit) equity. Since the Partnership issued common units and preferred units as consideration in exchange for the financing receivables in the April 2020 Transaction, we recorded the financing receivables as contra-equity.

If the net book value exceeds our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is calculated as the amount the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value associated with the asset.

The update will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models may result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. This update also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021 for SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies. Early adoption is permitted, but not earlier than January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. Management is currently evaluating the appropriate date of adoption and the effect of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements. The effect will largely depend on the composition and terms of our financial instruments at the time of adoption."

As a result, the transaction was treated as a financing arrangement. As the Norco Transaction was entered into simultaneously and in contemplation of the Mattox Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components, we allocated $546 million of the fair value of the consideration of the April 2020 Transaction to the Norco Transaction based on its relative stand-alone fair value to the other components of the April 2020 Transaction. From this amount, we recorded financing receivables of $302 million, based on the fair value of the Norco Assets' property, plant and equipment transferred from SOPUS and Shell Chemical, using a combination of market and cost valuation approaches. The financing receivables were recorded as the fair value of property, plant and equipment because the annual payments received by the Partnership are directly related to the lease of the property, plant and equipment of the Norco Assets. Since the financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical arose from transactions involving the issuance of the Partnership's common and preferred units, the financing receivables are presented as a component of (deficit) equity and not as assets on the balance sheet."

Because we had more than one class of participating securities, we used the two-class method when calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners. Effective April 1, 2020, the classes of participating securities included only common units, as the general partner units and the IDRs were eliminated and the Series A Preferred Units are not considered a participating security. See Note 11 – (Deficit) Equity for a discussion of the elimination of our general partner's IDRs and \\(2\\%\\) economic interest effective April 1, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Series A Preferred Units were dilutive to net income per limited partner unit.

Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. For both December 31, 2020 and 2019, these costs and any related liabilities are not material."

The extent to which the awards vest is determined over a three-year performance period. Half of the award is linked to the key performance indicators, averaged over the period. The other half of the award is linked to a comparison with four main competitors of RDS over the period on the basis of four relative performance measures. All shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the award date to the vesting date. None of the awards result in beneficial ownership until the shares are delivered. Shares are awarded subject to a three-year vesting period."

Reimbursements under this agreement equal the amount of tax our applicable operating subsidiaries would be required to pay with respect to such activity, if such subsidiaries were to file a combined or unitary tax return separate from Shell. Shell will compute and invoice us for the tax reimbursement amount within 15 days of Shell filing its combined or unitary tax return on which such activity is included. We may be required to make prepayments toward the tax reimbursement amount to the extent that Shell is required to make estimated tax payments during the relevant tax year. The tax sharing agreement currently in place is effective for all taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2017. The current agreement replaced a similar tax sharing agreement between Zydeco and Shell, which was effective for all tax periods ending before December 31, 2017.

The measurement of current expected credit losses under the new guidance is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including third-party trade receivables. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured.

If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying values based on the long-lived asset's ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our management's estimate of forecasted undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether the assets are recoverable (i.e., the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the net carrying value of the assets). If the assets are not recoverable, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. We determined that there were no asset impairments in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018."

Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the statement of income.

The revenue standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations."

Revenue is recognized when each performance obligation is satisfied under the terms of the contract. Each barrel of product transported or day of services provided is considered a distinct service that represents a performance obligation that would be satisfied over time if it were accounted for separately. The services provided over the contract period are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same, have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, and therefore, qualify as a single performance obligation. Since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of services, we recognize revenue over time based on a measure of progress of volumes transported for transportation services contracts, number of days elapsed for stand ready-transportation service contracts or number of days elapsed for storage services contracts."

Amberjack was formed in 2005 from a previous partnership between Shell Pipeline Company LP (\"Shell Pipeline\", \"Operator\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company (\"Shell Oil\") and Chevron Pipe Line Company (\"Chevron\"). Both Shell Pipeline and Chevron (collectively, the \"Members\") contributed cash and certain pipeline related assets to Amberjack. Following the formation, Amberjack issued two series of ownership interests wherein, (i) all the assets and liabilities of the former Partnership became the assets and liabilities of Amberjack Series A (\"Series A\") units, \\(75\\%\\) owned by Shell Pipeline and \\(25\\%\\) owned by Chevron and (ii) Amberjack Series B (\"Series B\") units were owned \\(50\\%\\) by Shell Pipeline and \\(50\\%\\) by Chevron. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series B units were used to fund the construction of the Tahiti pipeline. Amberjack is an LLC, and as such, no Member is liable for debts, obligations or liabilities, including under a judgment decree or order of a court, and shall continue until such time as a certificate of cancellation is filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware."

These events include market declines that are believed to be other-than-temporary, changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long-lived asset, decisions to sell an asset and adverse changes in the legal or business environment, such as adverse actions by regulators. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying values based on the long-lived asset's ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our management's estimate of forecasted undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether the assets are recoverable (i.e., the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the net carrying value of the assets). If the assets are not recoverable, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. In October 2020 Chevron filed a notification of the cessation of production of the GC 205 platform to the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. As a result of this filing, a review of abandoning the South Corridor assets was performed. After carefully evaluating the current fair value, it was determined that a $3,455,840 impairment was to be included on the Depreciation and amortization line in the accompany statements of income for 2020. No other impairments have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018."

Our assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease costs are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease costs are split, where amortization of the ROU asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense."

Each barrel of product transported is considered a distinct service that represents a performance obligation that would be satisfied over time if it were accounted for separately. The services provided over the contract period are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same, have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, and therefore, qualify as a single performance obligation.

These reviews assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our net income in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. For both December 31, 2020 and 2019, these costs and any related liabilities are not material."
