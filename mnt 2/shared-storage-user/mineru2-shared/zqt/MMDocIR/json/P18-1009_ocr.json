This formulation allows us to use a new type of distant supervision at large scale: head words, which indicate the type of the noun phrases they appear in. We show that these ultra-fine types can be crowd-sourced, and introduce new evaluation sets that are much more diverse and fine-grained than existing benchmarks. We present a model that can predict open types, and is trained using a multitask objective that pools our new head-word supervision with prior supervision from entity linking. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is effective in predicting entity types at varying granularity; it achieves state of the art performance on an existing fine-grained entity typing benchmark, and sets baselines for our newly-introduced datasets.\\(^1\\)"

This approach has two limitations: recall can suffer due to KB incompleteness (West et al., 2014), and precision can suffer when the selected types do not fit the context (Ritter et al., 2011). We alleviate the recall problem by mining entity mentions that were linked to Wikipedia in HTML, and extract relevant types from their encyclopedic definitions (Section 3.1). To address the precision issue (context-insensitive labeling), we propose a new source of distant supervision: automatically extracted nominal head words from raw text (Section 3.2). Using head words as a form of distant supervision provides fine-grained information about named entities and nominal mentions. While a KB may link \"the 44th president of the United States\" to many types such as author, lawyer, and professor, head words provide only the type \"president\", which is relevant in the context."

All sources of supervision appear to be useful, with crowdsourced examples making the biggest impact. Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels, while entity linking improves fine label prediction.

To convert the label space, we manually map a single noun from our natural-language vocabulary to each formal-language type in the OntoNotes ontology. \\(77\\%\\) of OntoNote's types directly correspond to suitable noun labels (e.g. \"doctor\" to \"/person/doctor\"), whereas the other cases were mapped with minimal manual effort (e.g. \"musician\" to \"person/artist/music\", \"politician\" to \"/person/political_figure\"). We then expand these labels according to the ontology to include their hypernyms (\"/person/political_figure\" will also generate \"/person\"). Lastly, we create negative examples by assigning the \"/other\" label to examples that are not mapped to the ontology. The augmented dataset contains 2.5M/0.6M new positive/negative examples, of which 0.9M/0.1M are from Wikipedia definition sentences and 1.6M/0.5M from head words."

These new forms of distant supervision boost performance on our new dataset as well as on an existing fine-grained entity typing benchmark. These results set the first performance levels for our evaluation dataset, and suggest that the data will support significant future work."
