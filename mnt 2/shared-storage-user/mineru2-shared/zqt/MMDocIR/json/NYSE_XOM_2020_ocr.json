ExxonMobil is the global leader in carbon capture and has more than 30 years of experience developing and deploying CCS technologies. We also have an equity share of about one-fifth of the world's CO2 capture capacity and are evaluating multiple opportunities to expand capacity. Furthermore, we are working on negative emissions technologies, like direct air capture, which uses advanced materials to capture CO2 from the atmosphere."

With respect to the environment, throughout ExxonMobil's businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground, including, but not limited to, compliance with environmental regulations. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil's 2020 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil's share of equity company expenditures, were \\(4.5 billion, of which \\)3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $4.9 billion in 2021 and 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 25 percent of the total."

The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, trade tariffs, security or public health issues and responses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. Demand reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as accompanying conditions of oversupply have led to a significant decrease in commodity prices and margins. Future business results, including cash flows and financing needs, will be affected by the extent and duration of these conditions and the effectiveness of responsive actions that the Corporation and others take, including actions to reduce capital and operating expenses, and actions taken by governments and others to address the COVID-19 pandemic including the ongoing development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and the impact of the pandemic on national and global economies and markets."

For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries to OPEC production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, government policies that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors' operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals."

In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award."

These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability of or increase the cost for, financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied, they could have the potential to negatively affect investment returns, make our products more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions."

For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity planning."

Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects."

On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020."

Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's near-term reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels, mainly related to unconventional drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending."

During 2020, extensions, primarily in the United States and Canada, resulted in an addition of approximately 0.5 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves.

ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field."

By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the contractor to relinquish 10 to 20 percent of the contract area after three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50 to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms."

This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation's assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the Corporation's strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions."

The Corporation's total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry.

The share of coal fired generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 20 percent of the world's electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40 percent in 2018, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks related to climate change. From 2018 to 2040, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely to nearly double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and solar is likely to increase about 400 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to account for about 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2040. Total renewables will likely reach about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2040. Natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period to 2040, reaching more than 25 percent and about 10 percent of global electricity supplies respectively by 2040.

The non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to about 65 percent by 2040, as liquid fuels demand in the OECD is likely to decline by close to 15 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels – are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world's resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and lower carbon supply options. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies."

For many years, the Corporation has taken into account policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy. The climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies, which often target specific sectors. It estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by using various assumptions and tools – including, depending on the sector, application of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive fuel economy standards). For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\) emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per tonne in 2040 in OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The Corporation continues to monitor the updates to the NDCs that nations are expected to provide in preparation for COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 as well as other policy developments in light of net zero ambitions recently formulated by some nations."

In early 2021 ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize low-carbon technologies. The business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), one of the critical technologies required to achieve the climate objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement. In addition to CCS, the business will also leverage ExxonMobil's significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. Other technology focus areas will be added in the future as they mature to commercialization."

Significant progress was made on key new developments in Guyana and in the Permian basin during 2020. In Guyana, exploration success continued with three additional discoveries increasing the estimated recoverable resource to nearly 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels on the Stabroek block. In the Permian, despite economic curtailments and reduced capital investment, production volumes averaged 367 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2020, a 35 percent year-on-year production increase which exceeded expectations, while development and operating costs were significantly reduced.

In 2020, construction progressed on our joint venture ethane cracker and associated units near Corpus Christi, Texas. The project is below budget and expected to start up ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter of 2021. We made the decision to slow the pace of other U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects, capturing current market efficiencies to offset deferral costs.

Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time.

Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. In light of the current low commodity price environment, and depending on the extent and pace of recovery, the Corporation's planned divestment program could be adversely affected by fewer financially suitable buyers. This could result in a slowing of the pace of divestments, certain assets being sold at a price below current book value, or impairment charges if the likelihood of divesting certain assets increases. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation's common stock, or both."

The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the Upstream, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $475 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $165 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period."

The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in Item 2."

Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and development and production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses."

This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the Corporation's assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments."

Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, and discount rates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group."

Those situations primarily related to the annual review and approval of the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio to prioritize assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize resources within current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort included a re-assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation's future development plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry gas portfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas regions of the U.S. as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non-cash, after-tax charges of $18.4 billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other after-tax impairment charges in 2020 include $0.5 billion in Upstream and $0.3 billion in Downstream. As a result of these impairments, the Corporation expects lower 2021 depreciation and depletion charges in Upstream for most of these asset groups. However, largely due to the impact of lower 2020 proved reserves resulting from low prices, higher unit-of-production rates on certain assets in 2021 are expected to offset the effect of lower depreciation and depletion charges related to 2020 impairments. For further discussion on proved reserves, see Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves in the Disclosure of Reserves section in Item 2."

Pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2020 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20-year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $210 million before tax."

If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of assets. These evaluations make use of management's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities."

Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects to receive when the customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. The prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available. Such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases. These performance obligations are based on market prices at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility."

Under the unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life."

On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and development and production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses."

This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the Corporation's assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments."

The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard requires this expected loss methodology for trade receivables, certain other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures.

This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle. In 2020, the Corporation identified a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Those situations primarily related to the annual review and approval of the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio to prioritize assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize resources within current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort included a re-assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation's future development plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry gas portfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas regions of the U.S., as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non-cash, before-tax charges of \\(24.4 billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other before-tax impairment charges in 2020 included \\)0.9 billion in Upstream, $0.5 billion in Downstream, and $0.1 billion in Chemical. Impairment charges are primarily recognized in the lines \"Depreciation and depletion\" and \"Exploration expenses, including dry holes\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income."

The portion of the fixed payment related to service costs for drilling equipment, tankers and finance leases is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities.

Awards that are forfeited, expire, or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2020, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 71 million."

Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50 percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years."

If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, \"significant\" includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole."

ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On September 4, 2019, the SDNY dismissed the Contractors' petition to recognize and enforce the Erha arbitration award. The Contractors filed a notice of appeal in the Second Circuit on October 2, 2019. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition."

The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S. federal district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. These positions are reflected in the unrecognized tax benefits table above. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court ruled that no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. Proceedings in the District Court are continuing. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's operations or financial condition."

This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020."

Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's near-term reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels, mainly related to unconventional drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending."

The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation's expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change."
