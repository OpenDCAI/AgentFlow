Established by congressional statute, J/IRF is guided by the principles enshrined in the First Amendment as well as in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: that individuals are free to believe or not believe, to change their beliefs, speak about their beliefs, and to manifest their beliefs through teaching, practice, worship, and observance. While driven by American values, these efforts represent a vital national security imperative. The absence of religious freedom weakens social cohesion and alienates citizens from their government, in turn fomenting inequality, resentment, and unrest. Conversely, expanding religious freedom and bundled rights (such as assembly, association, and expression) fosters political stability, economic growth, and human security, including here at home."

Religious freedom can't be fully realized unless other human rights are respected, and when governments violate their people's right to believe and worship freely, it jeopardizes all the others. And religious freedom is a key element of an open and stable society. Without it, people aren't able to make their fullest contribution to their country's success.

Effective program design is grounded in a qualitative analysis of the context and issue, supplemented – where possible – by empirical evidence. Learning from ongoing work allows for the expansion of successful work to new contexts. Moreover, evaluations help ensure programs abide by the “do no harm principle.” Increased monitoring and evaluation ensure that programs have a positive impact, are cost effective, and do not result in negative unintended consequences."
