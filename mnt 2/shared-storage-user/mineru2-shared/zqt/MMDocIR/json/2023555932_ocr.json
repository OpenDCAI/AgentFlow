                "content": "SUMMARY The statutory regulation of lobbyingists in the UK is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior to the enactment of legislation in 2014, registers and voluntary codes of conduct were relied upon to provide clarity during the political process. In 2014, the government introduced the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 (2014 Act), which requires consultant lobbyists to provide their details to a publicly available register. The 2014 Act did not address the threat from state actors, but instead focused on increasing transparency for the activities of consultant lobbyists and the government did not consider it appropriate to amend the act to tackle the actions of these actors. Instead, it included a Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS) in the National Security Act 2023 (2023 Act) to counter activities that are arranged with foreign powers and that are considered to threaten the interests and security of the UK. The 2023 Act contains two tiers of registration: an enhanced tier with broad application to all activities directed from specified foreign powers and a political influence tier that covers activities that aim to influence politics in the UK directed by a foreign power."
