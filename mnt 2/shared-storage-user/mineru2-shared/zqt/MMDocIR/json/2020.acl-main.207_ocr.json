For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce ScIDOCs, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.<sup>1</sup>"

Inspired by the recent success of pretrained Transformer language models across various NLP tasks, we use the Transformer model architecture as a basis of encoding the input paper. Existing LMs such as BERT, however, are primarily based on masked language modeling objective, only considering intra-document context and do not use any inter-document information. This limits their ability to learn optimal document representations. To learn high-quality document-level representations we propose using citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulate it as a triplet loss learning objective. We then pretrain the model on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not. We call our model SPECTER, which learns Scientific Paper Embeddings using Citation-informed Transformers. With respect to the terminology used by Devlin et al. (2019), unlike most existing LMs that are \"fine-tuning based\", our approach results in embeddings that can be applied to downstream tasks in a \"feature-based\" fashion, meaning the learned paper embeddings can be easily used as features, with no need for further task-specific fine-tuning. In the following, as background information, we briefly describe how pretrained LMs can be applied for document representation and then discuss the details of SPECTER."

Specifically, we use SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) which is an adaptation of the original BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) architecture to the scientific domain. The BERT model architecture (Devlin et al., 2019) uses multiple layers of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) to encode the tokens in a given input sequence. Each layer consists of a self-attention sublayer followed by a feedforward sublayer. The final hidden state associated with the special [CLS] token is usually called the \"pooled output\", and is commonly used as an aggregate representation of the sequence."

But, random negatives may be easy for the model to distinguish from the positives. To provide a more nuanced training signal, we augment the randomly drawn negatives with a more challenging second set of negative examples. We denote as \"hard negatives\" the papers that are not cited by the query paper, but are cited by a paper cited by the query paper, i.e. if \\(\\mathcal{P}^1 \\xrightarrow{\\text{cite}} \\mathcal{P}^2\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}^2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{cite}} \\mathcal{P}^3\\) but \\(\\mathcal{P}^1 \\xrightarrow{\\text{cite}} \\mathcal{P}^3\\), then \\(\\mathcal{P}^3\\) is a candidate hard negative example for \\(\\mathcal{P}^1\\). We expect the hard negatives to be somewhat related to the query paper, but typically less related than the cited papers.

In our case, we would expect that when users look for academic papers, the papers they view in a single browsing session tend to be related. Thus, accurate paper embeddings should, all else being equal, be relatively more similar for papers that are frequently viewed in the same session than for other papers. To build benchmark datasets to test embeddings on user activity, we obtained logs of user sessions from a major academic search engine.

We use a dataset of user clickthrough data for this task which consists of 22K clickthrough events from a public scholarly search engine. We partitioned the examples temporally into train (20K examples), validation (1K), and test (1K) sets. As is typical in clickthrough data on ranked lists, the clicks are biased toward the top of original ranking presented to the user. To counteract this effect, we computed propensity scores using a swap experiment (Agarwal et al., 2019). The propensity scores give, for each position in the ranked list, the relative frequency that the position is over-represented in the data due to exposure bias. We can then compute de-biased evaluation metrics by dividing the score for each test example by the propensity score for the clicked position. We report propensity-adjusted versions of the standard ranking metrics Precision@1 (P@1) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)."

For each query paper we construct up to 5 training triples comprised of a query, a positive, and a negative paper. The positive papers are sampled from the direct citations of the query, while negative papers are chosen either randomly or from citations of citations (as discussed in §2.4). We empirically found it helpful to use 2 hard negatives (citations of citations) and 3 easy negatives (randomly selected papers) for each query paper. This process results in about 684K training triples and 145K validation triples."

We initialize the model from SciBERT pretrained weights (Beltagy et al., 2019) since it is the state-of-the-art pretrained language model on scientific text. We continue training all model parameters on our training objective (Equation 2). We perform minimal tuning of our model's hyperparameters based on the performance on the validation set, while baselines are extensively tuned. Based on initial experiments, we use a margin \\( m = 1 \\) for the triplet loss. For training, we use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) following the suggested hyperparameters in Devlin et al. (2019) (LR: 2e-5, Slanted Triangular LR scheduler<sup>10</sup> (Howard and Ruder, 2018) with number of train steps equal to training instances and cut fraction of 0.1). We train the model on a single Titan V GPU (12G memory) for 2 epochs, with batch size of 4 (the maximum that fit in our GPU memory) and use gradient accumulation for an effective batch size of 32. Each training epoch takes approximately 1-2 days to complete on the full dataset. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.<sup>11</sup>"

We also compare with Citeomatic (Bhagavatula et al., 2018), a closely related paper representation model for citation prediction which trains content-based representations with citation graph information via dynamically sampled triplets, and SGC (Wu et al., 2019a), a state-of-the-art graph-convolutional approach.

We observe that removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance. More surprisingly, adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance.\\(^{13}\\) One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. As another possible reason of this behavior, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names. Many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT and thus, they might be split into sub-words and shared across names that are not semantically related, leading to noisy correlation. Finally, we find that adding venues slightly decreases performance,\\(^{14}\\) except on document classification (which makes sense, as we would expect venues to have high correlation"

Specifically, we fine-tune SciBERT directly on task-specific signals instead of citations.

These works typically do not leverage the recent pretrained contextual representations and with a few exceptions such as the recent work by Wang et al. (2019), they cannot generalize to unseen documents like our SPECTER approach. Context-based citation recommendation is another related application where models rely on citation contexts (Jeong et al., 2019) to make predictions. These works are orthogonal to ours as the input to our model is just paper title and abstract. Another related line of work is graph-based representation learning methods (Bruna et al., 2014; Kipf and Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017a,b; Wu et al., 2019a,b). Here, we compare to a graph representation learning model, SGC (Simple Graph Convolution) (Wu et al., 2019a), which is a state-of-the-art graph convolution approach for representation learning. SPECTER uses pretrained language models in combination with graph-based citation signals, which enables it to outperform the graph-based approaches in our experiments."

We used citations to build triplets for our loss function, however there are other metrics that have good support from the bibliometrics literature (Klavans and Boyack, 2006) that warrant exploring as a way to create relatedness graphs. Including other information such as outgoing citations as additional input to the model would be yet another area to explore in future."

The authors fine-tuned BERT using a triplet loss, where positive sentences were from the same document section as the seed sentence, and distractor sentences came from other document sections. The model is designed to encode sentences as opposed to paragraphs, so we embed the title and each sentence in the abstract separately, sum the embeddings, and L2 normalize the result to produce a final 768-dimensional paper embedding.\\(^{18}\\)"

There were a total of 9 parameter combinations. The IDF values were estimated on the training set. The other parameters were set as follows: min_rf=3, max_rf=0.75, strip accents='ascii', stop_words='english', norm=None, lowercase=True. For training of fasttext, we used all default parameters with the exception of setting dimension to 300 and minCount was set to 25 due to the large corpus."
