However, since counsel in this MDL have, at the direction of this Court, historically filed suggestions of death and motions to substitute (as they are likely the first parties to be apprised of the death of their clients) the Court will consider the Oppositions. District courts disagree as whether an attorney for a deceased plaintiff may file a suggestion of death on behalf of the deceased plaintiff. As Judge Duval in the Eastern District explained, \"[i]t has been held that the attorney for the deceased party may not make the suggestion of death since he is not himself a party to the action and, since his authority to represent the deceased terminates on the death, he is not a 'representative of the deceased party' of the sort contemplated in the rule.\" Behler v. Nautical Offshore, No. 03-1681, 2004 WL 2491612, at *1 (E.D. La. 2004) (quoting 7C WRIGHT, MILLER, KANE, & MARCUS, FED. PRAC. AND PROC. § 1955 at 545 (3d ed., April 2023 update)). Other district courts have held the opposite. See, e.g., Jones v. Inlet Marina, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 238, 240 (E.D. N.Y. Nov. 30, 2001) (noting that it \"is permissible for the former attorney of the decedent to file the suggestion of death, even though the attorney-client relationship ceased\"). Notably, the MDL court in In re Aredia & Zometa issued a case management order requiring counsel for the deceased plaintiffs to file a suggestion of death within 60 days of the death of the plaintiff. No. 3:06-md-01760 (M.D. Tenn. July 28, 2006), ECF No. 89, 103. The order also mandated that the 90-day time period run from the initial filing of the suggestion of death—thereby modifying the deadline under Sampson. See id."

Brennan, the Fifth Circuit held that Rule 4 service on the executrix of an estate was required to grant a motion for substitution, even if the executrix had notice of the motion for substitution. Sampson, 780 F.3d at 682 (citing Ransom, 437 F.2d at 519). However, with regard to whether service of the notice of the defendant's death was ever perfected, the Ransom court simply stated that the defendant's attorney suggested the defendant's death on the record. Sampson, 780 F.3d at 682-83 (citing Ransom, 437 F.2d at 515). In distinguishing Ransom from the case before them, the Sampson court explained that while \"the Ransom court seemed to accept that the deceased-defendant's attorney properly suggested the defendant's death, the issue of what constituted proper service for the notice of death was not before the court.\" Id. The Sampson court also chastised the district court for making an \"inferential leap\" by way of assuming, (absent any evidence in the record), that no representative of the deceased defendant's estate was in existence when the suggestion was filed, and therefore personal service was not required to trigger Rule 25's 90-day time period."
