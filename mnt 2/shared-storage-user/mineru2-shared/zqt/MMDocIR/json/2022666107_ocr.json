In that case, the Board found that the proposed design did not comply with the NCC because it failed to meet safety and performance requirements.[25] This decision indicates that the assessment of buildings is focused on a building's performance, safety, and structural integrity, as opposed to the use of a particular technology or material itself."

To date, it appears that mass timber buildings in New Zealand remain under six stories high; however, with the introduction of the Mid-Rise Wood Construction Partnership, this may soon change. At present, New Zealand's construction and building sector remains governed by the Building Act 2004, the Building Regulations 1992, and the Building Code.
