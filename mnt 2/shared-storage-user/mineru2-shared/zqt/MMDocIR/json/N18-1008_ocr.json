First, we introduce a model where the second task decoder receives information from the decoder of the first task, since higher-level intermediate representations should provide useful information. Second, we apply regularization that encourages transitivity and invertibility. We show that the application of these notions on jointly trained models improves performance on the tasks of low-resource speech transcription and translation. It also leads to better performance when using attention information for word discovery over unsegmented input."

Thus, we present a novel architecture for tied multitask learning with sequence-to-sequence models, in which the decoder of the second task receives information not only from the encoder, but also from the decoder of the first task."

First, an increase in the number of speakers hurts the performance of the speech transcription tasks. The character error rates for Ainu are smaller than the CER in Mboshi, which in turn are smaller than the CER in CALLHOME. Second, the character-level BLEU scores increase as the amount of training data increases, with our smallest dataset (Ainu) having the lowest BLEU scores, and the largest dataset (CALLHOME) having the highest BLEU scores. This is expected, as more training data means that the translation decoder learns a more informed character-level language model for the target language."
