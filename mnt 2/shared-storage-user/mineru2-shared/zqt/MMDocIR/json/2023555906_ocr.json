All the countries reviewed are parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, except for India and Saudi Arabia. It appears that these two countries do not have specific legislation governing the granting of asylum and refugee status. In all the other surveyed jurisdictions, these issues are governed by national laws and executive regulations issued by authorities in charge of resolving migration-related issues. Most of the countries included in this survey require an applicant's physical presence at the border or within the country's territory. In some countries (Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey), a time limit for the period when an application can be submitted is in place. Canada and Mexico each accept asylum applications from outside of the country. Canada processes such applications as a part of its visa application process, while Mexico allows submitting a petition from outside of the country for political asylum only. Brazil, as a party to the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum of the Organization of American States, allows applicants to request diplomatic asylum in Brazilian embassies abroad. Australia and Canada allow humanitarian protection and refugee status requests from abroad when protection is sought through a resettlement program administered by the United Nations, another designated referral agency, or by private sponsorship. In Russia, current legislation enables consular offices abroad to review applications and grant temporary protection status that allows entry to the country; however, this provision is excluded from a recently introduced bill."
