When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.

These charges primarily relate to transaction and third-party support costs, business separation and applicable employee retention fees, pension settlement charges and related tax charges.

Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company's acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business."

Client buying needs for application and infrastructure services are diverging, while adoption of our hybrid cloud platform is accelerating. This change in clients' needs makes it the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best. IBM will focus on its open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities to accelerate clients' digital transformations. Upon separation, NewCo will immediately be the world's leading managed infrastructure services provider and will have greater agility to design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world's most important organizations. Both IBM and NewCo will have greater ability to focus on their operating and financial models, have more freedom to partner with others and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. We are on track to complete the separation by the end of 2021."

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in 2020 were $7.8 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.13 as reported and $8.67 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We also generated $18.2 billion in cash from operations, $10.8 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.8 billion in dividends. With the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainty beginning in March 2020, client priorities shifted to maintaining operational stability, flexibility and preservation of cash. While there was continued demand for offerings that support their digital transformation, clients moved to shorter term duration engagements and prioritized operational expenditures over capital expenditures, which impacted the company's performance in 2020. However, our results reflect strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation. We also continued to strengthen our position as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company through strategic organic investments and acquisitions."

With the full support of our Board of Directors, beginning in April 2021 we will disclose annually an overview of our diversity, pay equity and inclusion efforts and programs, including diversity representation data. We are proud of our inclusive culture, with nine out of ten employees responding that they can be their authentic selves at work. Our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace led to increased engagement levels for women, Black and Hispanic employees. We are also focused on meeting or exceeding the diversity of skilled talent in the labor market, for every underrepresented group, and at every level of our company. Women now make up more than 33 percent of our workforce, and we increased representation of women, Black and Hispanic employees in 2020 compared to the prior year. While we have taken significant actions and made progress, we have ongoing work to do. IBM believes in pay equity: we have had an equal pay policy since 1935 and a long-standing practice of maintaining pay equity. To this end, we conduct statistical pay equity analysis that includes all countries with IBM employees. We also empower employees to understand their pay by providing comprehensive education and transparent access to pay statements including a comparison to market pay ranges."

Fourth quarter operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $1.9 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.41 as reported and $2.07 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations, $6.1 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in dividends. While challenges related to macroeconomic uncertainty and product cycle dynamics continued, our fourth-quarter results reflect strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation."

The year-to-year decline in our software performance reflects the continued challenging transactional environment due to the macroeconomic environment in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since the fourth quarter is seasonally our largest transactional quarter, this was more impactful than in other quarters in 2020. Additionally, we had strong software performance in the fourth quarter of 2019, the peak in our enterprise license agreement (ELA) cycle, where clients renew, on average, about every three years. With the uncertainty our clients are facing in the current environment, many clients opted for shorter duration ELAs. This dynamic, in combination with the large seasonal volume of ELAs in the fourth quarter, impacted our software revenue performance. We had strong year-to-year renewal rates for subscription and support in the fourth-quarter 2020, reflecting our clients' commitment to our critical software solutions. We had solid growth in Cloud & Data Platforms led by Red Hat's continued strong performance. Cognitive Applications grew slightly as reported, but declined adjusted for currency.

Application Management declined as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. We had growth in offerings that help clients develop and manage cloud applications and modernize and automate their application portfolio, offset by continued decline in the more traditional application management engagements. GPS revenue decreased year to year as demand shifted away from traditional Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) offerings to new business platforms around intelligent workflows. Within GBS, cloud revenue of $5.2 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year."

                "content": "On October 8, 2020, we announced our plan to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of our GTS segment into a new public company, currently referred to as NewCo. The separation is expected to be achieved through a U.S. federal tax-free spin-off to IBM shareholders and be completed by the end of 2021. This creates two industry-leading companies, each with strategic focus and flexibility to capitalize on their respective missions and drive client and shareholder value. Client buying needs for application and infrastructure services are diverging, while adoption of our hybrid cloud platform is accelerating. This change in clients' needs makes it the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best. IBM will accelerate our open hybrid cloud platform growth strategy and AI capabilities to drive clients' digital transformations. NewCo will design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world's most important organizations. Both IBM and NewCo will have greater agility to focus on their operating and financial models, have more freedom to partner with others and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. We remain on track to complete the separation by the end of 2021."

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate. However, it is not expected to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results."

We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Global Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric."

As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.5 billion in the next five years. The 2021 contributions are currently expected to be approximately $300 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2020. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status.

Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPP's PBO of an estimated $1.3 billion based upon December 31, 2020 data."

References to \"adjusted for currency\" or \"constant currency\" reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2020. Based on the currency rate movements in 2020, total revenue decreased 4.6 percent as reported and 4.7 percent at constant currency versus 2019. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately \\(280 million in 2020 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately \\)290 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $300 million in 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of $260 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but we believe it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace."

As a result, management recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. As further described by management, these tax liabilities are recognized when, despite management's belief that the tax return positions are supportable, management believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Management bases its assessment of the accruals for tax liabilities on many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits were $8.6 billion."

This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate management's timely identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often inherently subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge."

The company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage.

Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (i.e., setup costs) incurred in the initial phases of outsourcing contracts and other cloud-based services contracts, including Software-as-a-Service arrangements, are capitalized when the costs relate directly to the contract, the costs generate or enhance resources of the company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. These costs consist of transition and setup costs related to the installation of systems and processes and other deferred fulfillment costs, including, for example, prepaid assets used in services contracts (i.e., prepaid software or prepaid maintenance). Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which includes anticipated contract renewals or extensions, consistent with the transfer to the client of the services to which the asset relates. Additionally, fixed assets associated with these contracts are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. If an asset is contract specific, then the depreciation period is the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the contract term. Amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair value of acquired assets used in outsourcing arrangements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of revenue over the expected period of benefit. The company performs periodic reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred contract transition and setup costs. If the carrying amount is deemed not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized. Refer to note C, \"Revenue Recognition,\" for the amount of deferred costs to fulfill a contract at December 31, 2020 and 2019."

The company estimates its standard warranty costs for products based on historical warranty claim experience and estimates of future spending and applies this estimate to the revenue stream for products under warranty. Estimated future costs for warranties applicable to revenue recognized in the current period are charged to cost of sales. The warranty liability is reviewed quarterly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.

Income is recognized over time if the nature of the company's promise is to provide a right to access the company's intellectual property throughout the license period (i.e., the license is symbolic intellectual property), such as a trademark license. Licensing arrangements include IP partnerships whereby a business partner licenses source code from the company and becomes responsible for developing, maintaining and enhancing the product. The company retains its customers and go-to-market capability and any royalty due to the partner is recognized in cost of sales. The IP partner has the rights to market the product and its derivative works under its own brand and remits royalty to the company on those sales, which are recorded as royalty-based fees. Depending on the nature of the transaction, an IP partnership would be accounted for as a divestiture if the company concludes the transaction meets the definition of a business. Income from royalty-based fee arrangements is recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs or the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). The company also enters into cross-licensing arrangements of patents, and income from these arrangements is recognized when control transfers to the customer. In addition, the company earns income from certain custom development projects with strategic technology partners and specific clients. The company records the income from these projects over time as the company satisfies the performance obligation if the fee is nonrefundable and is not dependent upon the ultimate success of the project."

For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels. For the nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of assets held in an irrevocable trust fund, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust fund. Overfunded plans, with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the benefit obligation, are aggregated and recorded as a prepaid pension asset equal to this excess. Underfunded plans, with the benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of plan assets, are aggregated and recorded as a retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligation equal to this excess."

The company grants its employees Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), including Retention Restricted Stock Units (RRSUs); Performance Share Units (PSUs); and periodically grants stock options. RSUs are stock awards granted to employees that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a one- to five-year period. PSUs are stock awards where the number of shares ultimately received by the employee depends on the company's performance against specified targets and typically vest over a three-year period. Over the performance period, the number of shares that will be issued is adjusted based upon the probability of achievement of performance targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. Dividend equivalents are not paid on the stock awards described above. The fair value of the awards is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the company's stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents where applicable and for PSUs assumes that performance targets will be achieved. The company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between asset and liability amounts that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. U.S. tax reform introduced Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), which subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the company elected to include GILTI in measuring deferred taxes. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. When the company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, the valuation allowance is adjusted with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made."

The average term of the real estate leases is approximately five years. The company also has equipment leases, such as IT equipment and vehicles, which have lease terms that range from two to five years. For certain of these operating and finance leases, the company applies a portfolio approach to account for the lease assets and lease liabilities."

Deferred income of $29 million was recorded for certain software licenses that will be recognized over time versus at point in time under previous guidance. Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $184 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, resulting in a cumulative effect net increase to retained earnings of $524 million. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million. The decrease to net deferred taxes was the result of the company’s election to include GILTI in measuring deferred taxes. The revenue guidance did not have a material impact in the company’s consolidated financial results. Refer to note C, “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information."

The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. RPO estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency."

The enactment of U.S. tax reform resulted in charges to tax expense of \\(0.1 billion and \\)2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, there was no impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform. In 2018, the charge was primarily attributable to the company's election to include GILTI in measuring deferred taxes, plus refinements to the one-time U.S. transition tax and foreign tax costs on undistributed foreign earnings. The charge in 2019 was related to additional tax reform guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019."

The IRS' proposed adjustments relative to these cross-border transactions, if sustained, would result in additional taxable income of approximately $4.5 billion. The company strongly disagrees with the IRS on these specific matters and intends to protest the proposed adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office and U.S. courts, if necessary. The company believes it has appropriately accounted for all of its uncertain tax positions. In the third quarter of 2018, the IRS commenced its audit of the company's U.S. tax returns for 2015 and 2016. The company anticipates that this audit will be completed in 2021. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2015. The company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013. The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years."

For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was \\(54,355 million and \\)54,102 million, and the estimated fair value was $61,598 million and $58,431 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy."

The new maturity dates for the 364-day and Three-Year Credit Agreements are July 1, 2021 and July 20, 2023, respectively. The company also amended its $10.25 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement to include an option exercisable in 2021 to extend the current maturity date of July 20, 2024 by an additional two years. Each of the facility sizes remained unchanged. The total expense recorded by the company related to the Five-Year Credit Agreement was $8 million in 2020, $7 million in 2019 and $7 million in 2018. The total expense recorded by the company related to the 364-day and Three-Year Credit Agreements was $4 million in 2020, $2 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018. The Five-Year Credit Agreement permits the company and its subsidiary borrowers to borrow up to $10.25 billion on a revolving basis. Borrowings of the subsidiary borrowers will be unconditionally backed by the company. The company may also, upon the agreement of either existing lenders, or of additional banks not currently party to the Five-Year Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement up to an additional $1.75 billion. The 364-day Credit Agreement and the Three-Year Credit Agreement allow the company and IBM Credit (each a Borrower) to borrow up to an aggregate of $5 billion on a revolving basis. Neither Borrower is a guarantor or co-bligor of the other Borrower under the 364-day and Three-Year Credit Agreements. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Five-Year, 364-day and Three-Year Credit Agreements (the Credit Agreements), the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the Credit Agreements at any time during the term of such agreements. Funds borrowed may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Borrowers."

The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company or its clients could become subject to actions or proceedings in various jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM's scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company's pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise."

Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company's experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the company's potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter."

On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling and denied SCO's appeal of this matter.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was \\(7.2 billion and \\)7.9 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.3 years and 0.1 years, respectively."

As a result of this court decision, IBM recorded an increase of $125 million to the PBO for the IBM UK defined benefit plan, which represents approximately 1 percent of the UK PBO. This amount was recorded as prior service cost in OCI for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2020, the High Court issued a follow-on judgment to the 2018 ruling which did not have a material impact to the PBO as of December 31, 2020."

Cash flows from the company&#x27;s expected benefit obligation payments are matched to the yield curve to derive the discount rates.In other non-U.S. countries where the markets for high-quality long-term bonds are not as well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a base, and a credit spread is added to simulate corporate bond yields at these maturities in the jurisdiction of each plan. This is the benchmark for developing the respective discount rates.</td></tr><tr><td>Expected Long-Term Returns on Plan Assets</td><td>Represents the expected long-term returns on plan assets based on the calculated market-related value of plan assets and considers long-term expectations for future returns and the investment policies and strategies discussed on pages 134 to 135. These rates of return are developed and tested for reasonableness against historical returns by the company.The use of expected returns may result in pension income that is greater or less than the actual return of those plan assets in a given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns, and therefore result in a pattern of income or loss recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees.The difference between actual and expected returns is recognized as a component of net loss or gain in AOCI, which is amortized as a component of net periodic (income)/cost over the service lives or life expectancy of the plan participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed certain thresholds provided by accounting standards. The market-related value of plan assets recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic (income)/cost.The projected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2021 is 3.75 percent for U.S. and 2.86 percent for non-U.S. DB Plans.</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of Compensation Increases and Mortality Assumptions</td><td>Compensation rate increases are determined based on the company&#x27;s long-term plans for such increases.These rate increases are not applicable to the U.S. DB pension plans as benefit accruals ceased December 31, 2007.Mortality assumptions are based on life expectancy and death rates for different types of participants and are periodically updated based on actual experience.</td></tr><tr><td>Interest Crediting Rate</td><td>Benefits for certain participants in the PPP are calculated using a cash balance formula. An assumption underlying this formula is an interest crediting rate, which impacts both net periodic (income)/cost and the PBO. This provides the basis for projecting the expected interest rate that plan participants will earn on the benefits that they are expected to receive in the following year and is based on the average from August to October of the one-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yield plus one percent.</td></tr><tr><td>Healthcare Cost Trend Rate</td><td>For nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. The healthcare cost trend rate has an insignificant effect on plan costs or the benefit obligation due to the terms of the plan which limit the company&#x27;s obligation to the participants.The company&#x27;s U.S. healthcare cost trend rate assumption for 2021 is 6.25 percent. The company assumes that trend rate will decrease to 5.0 percent over the next six years.</td></tr></table>"

The precise amount for which these obligations will be settled depends on future events, including the retirement dates and life expectancy of the plans' participants. The obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions, based on the current economic environment and other pertinent factors described above. The Qualified PPP portfolio's investment strategy balances the requirement to generate returns, using potentially higher yielding assets such as equity securities, with the need to control risk in the portfolio with less volatile assets, such as fixed-income securities. Risks include, among others, inflation, volatility in equity values and changes in interest rates that could cause the plan to become underfunded, thereby increasing its dependence on contributions from the company. To mitigate any potential concentration risk, careful consideration is given to balancing the portfolio among industry sectors, companies and geographies, taking into account interest rate sensitivity, dependence on economic growth, currency and other"
