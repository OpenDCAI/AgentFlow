Although they expect certain positive outcomes from these developments, their attitudes more frequently reflect worry and concern over the implications of these technologies for society as a whole."

The scenarios included: the development of autonomous vehicles that can operate without the aid of a human driver; a future in which robots and computers can perform many of the jobs currently done by human workers; the possibility of fully autonomous robot caregivers for older adults; and the possibility that a computer program could evaluate and select job candidates with no human involvement. The following are among the major findings."

But a variety of technological innovations – from industrial robots in manufacturing to the office productivity tools that have transformed the nature of white collar office work – have already had a profound impact on the nature of work in the present day. When asked about the impact of these and other technologies on their own jobs and careers, today's workers express decidedly mixed views. Many view these technologies in a positive light, but substantial shares view them as damaging (or at best neutral) to their own career prospects. Moreover, the survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment. It also finds that workforce automation has already impacted a minority of today's workers in the form of lost jobs or wages – and that many of these workers view technology as a broadly negative influence on the trajectory of their own careers."

These jobs include a mixture of physical and mental or cognitive work, as well as a mixture of routine and non-routine tasks. The findings indicate that Americans view some occupations as being more insulated from automation than others – but that few of today's workers consider their own jobs or professions to be vulnerable to this trend to any significant degree."

It is also highly correlated with Americans' overall familiarity and awareness of driverless vehicles more broadly. Among those who have heard a lot about the development of driverless vehicles, nearly six-in-ten (57%) would ride in one if given the opportunity. That share falls to 38% among those who have heard a little about this issue and to just 23% among the relatively small group of Americans who have not heard anything about driverless vehicles before."

The final step in the weighting uses an iterative technique that aligns the sample to population benchmarks on a number of dimensions. Gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and region parameters come from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey. The county-level population density parameter (deciles) comes from the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census.
