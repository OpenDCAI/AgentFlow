Factors that could cause future results to materially differ from the recent results or those projected in forward-looking statements include, among others: unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits, but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss of services of key personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions."

For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the SEC. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect a stockholder's ability to resell any of our shares in the public markets."

The region is marked by numerous magmatic events that developed in an orchestrated manner by the tectonics of the time. The PEG is characterized by a zone with type A granitic intrusions rich in tin and rare earth elements. These fertile granites are responsible for the formation of supergene deposits with exotic minerals such as fluocerite-Ce, ETR oxifluorides, bastnaesite, monazite, allanite, solid solutions of zircon-torite and xenotite-torite in addition to apatite, rich in rare earth elements (REE). PREG/T targets regions bordering the dome of these granites, since it is understood that the REE-enriched deposits would form as regolith of the generating fertile granite, being formed by sediments, transported and deposited in nearby depressions. The area has a history of Sn deposits in PEG, so its potential for REE was not explored until the last decade, after which the region's potential for world-class deposits was understood."

The Bambuí Group sits directly on a gneissic-migmatitic base of the ancient Archean crust, occurring sub-horizontally in the center-north portion of the area. Serra do Ramalho stands out as one of the main geomorphological features of the region.

The deposit is formed through supergene enrichment and soil formation, derived from ultramafic rocks from mantle intrusions and therefore forms metric layers of soil with high Nickel and Cobalt contents. Access to the mineralized layers occurs on surface, facilitating blasting and exploitation operations. In Piauí, the nickel deposits occur constrained to the fold belts Riacho do Pontal. This geological structure depicts tectonic stresses responsible for the rise of basic to ultrabasic fluids that crystallize element-rich minerals such as Nickel and Cobalt. The presence of these mineralized rocks added to the arid climate of the region results in the formation of soil layers enriched in these elements, such as in Goiás."

This river rises within the Diamantina Plateau, a region where more than alluvial diamond produced in the world for more than 200 years.

The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability.

If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the intangible asset is further tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow.

The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of our Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our Company's assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:"

On an annual basis, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, management reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances makes it more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the intangible asset is further tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow. Impairment, if any, is measured as the amount by which an indefinite-lived intangible asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value."

The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior.

Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value of our employee stock options, it is management's opinion that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.

ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06 will be effective January 1, 2024, for the Company. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. The Company is evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on the consolidated financial statements, but currently does not believe ASU 2020-06 will have a significant impact on the Company's accounting for its convertible debt instruments. The effect will largely depend on the composition and terms of the financial instruments at the time of adoption."

The Company's foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from the local currency into U.S. dollars in the following manner: (a) income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period; (b) balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates; and (c) equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Translation in this manner affects the shareholders' equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account. This account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries' U.S. dollar balance sheets and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets in agreement."
