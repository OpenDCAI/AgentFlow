The Refugee Convention was adopted on July 28, 1951, and entered into force on April 22, 1954. It has been ratified by 146 state parties, including the jurisdictions surveyed in this report. It defines the term “refugee” as “someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.” This definition has been implemented into the respective asylum laws of the surveyed jurisdictions. In some countries, such as Germany and Portugal, the right of asylum is also a constitutional right. In general, asylum status is awarded to people who meet the definition of refugee and are already present in the country in which they are seeking protection from persecution."

At what point in the asylum application process this requirement is examined varies from country to country. In Canada, it is not required for a referral for a hearing at the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The EU has enacted the Asylum Procedures Directive, which establishes common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection, meaning refugee status and subsidiary protection. Applicants are required to cooperate with the competent authorities and are entitled to a personal interview to determine their eligibility. The EU Member States surveyed in this report, meaning Germany, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Sweden, are obligated to transpose the EU directive into their national laws and comply with its requirements. Even though the UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, it has transposed a number of EU directives, including the Asylum Procedures Directive, into its national legislation. Likewise, Turkey's laws are largely in line with the EU laws, with the notable exception of the \"temporary protection\" status."

In the UK, where documentary or other proof of persecution is not available, authorities may still grant a claim of asylum if, among other criteria, the applicant has made a genuine effort to substantiate the claim. German caseworkers are provided with a standard set of questions to determine the eligibility of the applicant and must ask probing questions to clarify the facts presented by the applicant.

The risk to this group from Ghana is considered inherent, and no additional evidence of persecution is needed. However, the Migration Agency will look at information, including publicly available information, to determine whether the stated ground for persecution, such as sexual orientation, is likely to be true or false. The Migration Agency also uses safe country lists to determine when asylum is not warranted."

Persons arriving from Syria following the Syrian Civil War, which constitute a vast majority of the refugee population currently hosted in Turkey, are protected under the temporary protection status. The administrative procedure for the initial registration of asylum seekers and the determination of eventual status is unified for the convention refugee, conventional refugee, and subsidiary protection statuses, while the procedure is different for temporary protection. This report provides a detailed overview of the procedure in place to make the determinations to grant or deny protection status to asylum seekers, with a view to reflect the de facto practice where possible. Other aspects of Turkish refugee law, such as substantive rights and obligations that arise from applicant status or the granting of protection status, and the appeals processes against adverse decisions, are not covered."

A fast-track process has been developed to help reduce the extensive backlog of asylum cases, which allows certain applications to be rejected upon receipt if the individual is from a country deemed safe by the UK. For all other claimants, a decision is made by caseworkers from the Home Office on the well-established criteria of whether the individual has a well-founded fear of persecution or other harm."
