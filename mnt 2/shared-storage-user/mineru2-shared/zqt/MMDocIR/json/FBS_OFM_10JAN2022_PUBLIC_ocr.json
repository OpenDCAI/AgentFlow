Deterring, detecting, and investigating non-compliance of Department policy and local, state, and federal laws is essential to protect and safeguard national security. The ingenuity, resources, and globally present nature of criminal entities that engage in fraud pose a serious risk to U.S. foreign policy objectives. To mitigate that risk, OFM believes in a robust and multi-faceted approach that engages and relies on close coordination between all stakeholders. Data analytics provides insight into trends and identifies links between one case and another. This data is used to develop foreign mission specific policies and regulations responsive to the latest and most pertinent threats to U.S. policy and national security."
