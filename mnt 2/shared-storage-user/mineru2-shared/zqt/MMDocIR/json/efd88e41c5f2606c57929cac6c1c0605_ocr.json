It was called for under the President's Climate Action Plan and is a major contribution to the sustained National Climate Assessment process. The report was informed by input gathered in listening sessions and scientific and technical information contributed through open solicitations. It underwent rigorous reviews by the public and by scientific experts inside and outside of the government, including a special committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."

The report does assess scientific literature describing the role of adaptive capacity in creating, moderating, or exacerbating vulnerability to health impacts where appropriate. The report also cites analyses that include modeling parameters that make certain assumptions about emissions pathways or adaptive capacity in order to project climate impacts on human health. This scientific assessment of impacts helps build the integrated knowledge base needed to understand, predict, and respond to these changes, and it may help inform mitigation or adaptation decisions and other strategies in the public health arena."

The next seven chapters focus on specific climate-related health impacts and exposures: Temperature-Related Death and Illness; Air Quality Impacts; Extreme Events; Vector-Borne Diseases; Water-Related Illness; Food Safety, Nutrition, and Distribution; and Mental Health and Well-Being. A final chapter on Populations of Concern identifies factors that create or exacerbate the vulnerability of certain population groups to health impacts from climate change. That chapter also integrates information from the topical health impact chapters to identify specific groups of people in the United States who may face greater health risks associated with climate change."

For example, a population's vulnerability 1) may be affected by direct climate changes or by non-climate factors (such as changes in population, economic development, education, infrastructure, behavior, technology, and ecosystems); 2) may differ across regions and in urban, rural, coastal, and other communities; and 3) may be influenced by individual vulnerability factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and existing physical and/or mental illness or disability. These considerations are summarized in Chapter 1: Introduction: Climate Change and Human Health and Chapter 9: Populations of Concern. There are limited studies that quantify how climate impacts interact with the factors listed above or how these interactions can lead to many other compounding, secondary, or indirect health effects. However, where possible, this assessment identifies key environmental, institutional, social, and behavioral influences on health impacts."

In other cases, people may be threatened simultaneously by seemingly unconnected risks, such as increased exposure to Lyme disease and extreme heat.

Adaptive capacity ranges from an individual's ability to acclimatize to different meteorological conditions to a community's ability to prepare for and recover from damage, injuries, and lives lost due to extreme weather events. Awareness and communication of health threats to the public health community, practitioners, and the public is an important factor in the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of climate-related health outcomes. Recognition of these interactions, together with recognition of multiple sources of vulnerability, helps identify what information decision makers need as they manage risks."

The analyses are all published in external peer-reviewed sources, and the full description of modeling methods and findings can be found in those citations. While authors of these analyses were provided with modeling guidance and conferred on opportunities for consistency in approach, no comprehensive set of assumptions, timeframes, or scenarios were applied across modeling analyses. Therefore, these six studies do not represent an integrated modeling assessment.

The right gray box indicates the social and behavioral context that also affects a person's vulnerability to health impacts of climate change. This path includes factors such as race, gender, and age, as well as socioeconomic factors like income and education or behavioral factors like individual decision making. The examples listed in these two gray boxes can increase or reduce vulnerability by influencing the exposure pathway (changes in exposure) or health outcomes (changes in sensitivity or adaptive capacity).

These climate change impacts endanger our health by affecting our food and water sources, the air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments. As the climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow."

Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a person's vulnerability to climate-related health effects. The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges. While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions."
