Specifically, we explore two transfer methods to incorporate this sort of knowledge - pretraining and multi-task learning. In our experiments, we find that both methods are helpful and combining them achieves significant improvements over attention-based LSTM models trained only on aspect-level data. We also illustrate by examples that additional knowledge from document-level data is beneficial in multiple ways.

Pretraining is a common technique used in computer vision where low-level neural layers can be usefully transferred to different tasks (Krizhevsky and Sutskever, 2012; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014). In natural language processing (NLP), some efforts have been initiated on pretraining LSTMs (Dai and Le, 2015; Zoph et al., 2016; Ramachandran et al., 2017) for sequence-to-sequence models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, where promising results have been obtained. On the other hand, multi-task learning simultaneously trains on samples in multiple tasks with a combined objective (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Luong et al., 2015a; Liu et al., 2016), which has improved model generalization ability in certain cases. In the work of Mou et al. (2016), the authors investigated the transferability of neural models in NLP applications with extensive experiments, showing that transferability largely depends on the semantic relatedness of the source and target tasks. For our problem, we hypothesize that aspect-level sentiment classification can be improved by employing knowledge gained from document-level sentiment classification, as these two tasks are highly related semantically."
