The BRI is a transcontinental investment strategy and program with the aim of promoting economic connectivity and integration in more than 100 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa through a large set of rail, road, and sea infrastructure projects, energy pipelines, special economic zones, and other areas of cooperation meant to expand China's economic and political influence. In 2015, the Chinese government issued an official outline of the principles, framework, priorities of cooperation, and cooperation mechanisms of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (which together now are referred to as the BRI)."

Concerns also rose when Kenya was said to have waived its sovereign immunity in a loan agreement, potentially exposing key public assets to seizure by China in the event of a default. However, some observers note that although it is unlikely that China will seize the Mombasa port in the event that Kenya fails to meet its debt obligations, the possibility does give China leverage over Kenyan political decisions. Similarly, in Egypt, there is concern that the country may fail to repay its loans for major infrastructure projects because of the government's substantial debts, and that this may result in less Chinese investment in the future."

For example, some or all of the above factors may have contributed to China's willingness to renegotiate with Djibouti regarding its debt in respect to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. Pakistan also is negotiating with China in order to restructure the terms of energy projects, seeking to cut interest rates on current power sector-related loans and a 10-12 year extension on the debt repayment period."

As a result, China's Ministry of Finance formulated the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.[7] The aim of the framework is to promote sustainable economic and social development of BRI countries while ensuring debt sustainability. It is a nonmandatory policy tool to conduct debt sustainability analysis and manage debt risks to support lending decisions."

In Central Asia, for example, BRI projects are predominantly built by Chinese investors and companies, and such projects are disproportionately backed by Chinese state financiers. There has been considerable criticism over corruption and the lack of transparency, due diligence, and competitive bidding/fair procurement practices involved in BRI projects across host countries. For example, in Kenya, the China Road and Bridge Corporation was awarded the contract to build the SGR without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010 Constitution and 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. Similarly, in Pakistan, there were reported irregularities violating procurement rules in the award for highways and motorways projects. In Malaysia, some of the projects and deals have generated controversy and have formed part of the corruption allegations against Najib Razak, the former prime minister who initiated them. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant projects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country, and the former prime minister was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020. Concerns about potential violations of procurement processes, concessions in respect to local content, and fair labor practices have also been raised in a number of Caribbean countries."

However, according to available reports, it is not currently being used as a People's Liberation Army military base, and both governments have downplayed any military use for the port. Some experts note, however, that the port may still serve China's broader strategic and other policy objectives. In Greece, COSCO Shipping, a state-owned enterprise, has a majority stake in and operates the Piraeus Port Authority, making the Port of Piraeus the first major seaport in the European Union that is wholly managed by a Chinese company, raising strategic concerns among US and European allies. In Portugal, its maritime assets, the Port of Sines and the archipelago of the Azores, have attracted investment and strategic interest from China. In March 2019, President el-Sisi affirmed Egypt's support of the BRI, and he called for enhanced defense cooperation in August 2020. A Chinese company, Hutchison Ports, has signed a long-term agreement with the Egyptian navy for the development and operation of a new container terminal inside the Abu Qir Naval Base on the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, Djibouti hosts China's only foreign military base, a naval facility adjacent to the Doraleh Multipurpose Port from which it can participate in anti-piracy operations and generally safeguard its access to the strategic maritime route along the coast of the Horn of Africa."

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh signed \"bilateral cooperation documents\" under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on September 2, 2018, but Chinese BRI development in Djibouti predates the signing of those documents by at least five years. The legal framework for Djibouti's participation in the BRI is difficult to assess, as it rests on agreements that are not publicly available. The policy framework, on the other hand, seems easier to understand. China sees Djibouti as a crucial part of its Maritime Silk Road due to its geographic location. Meanwhile, Djibouti sees Chinese investment as providing the opportunity to further enhance its position as a commercial transportation hub and become the \"Singapore of Africa.\""

The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone, the first phase of which was inaugurated in 2018, is expected to be the largest of its kind in Africa once completed. It is being built by China Merchants Group and is run jointly by the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority and a subsidiary of China Merchants Group. The first phase represented an investment of US$370 million, of which a loan from the China Development Bank financed US$250 million. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway was inaugurated in 2017. It replaces a long-defunct rail line from the 1890s. It is the first rail line in Africa to be entirely electric, and it reduces the travel time between Addis Ababa and the City of Djibouti to about half a day instead of three days by road. The Djiboutian section of the railroad cost US$525 million, almost entirely financed by Chinese loans."

Djibouti's public and publicly guaranteed debt is indeed significant, rising to about \\(71\\%\\) of Gross Domestic Product in 2018. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund describe Djibouti's risk of debt distress as high, and China holds an overwhelming share of that debt. These risks could be mitigated by positive economic prospects, however. Furthermore, some observers believe that China may not be eager for a debt-for-equity swap, as that would come at significant reputational cost and may create the kind of uncertainty and instability that it would prefer to avoid. Additionally, the Djiboutian government has long experience in leveraging its strategic position to protect its interests. Some or all of these factors may have contributed to China's willingness to renegotiate the debt on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. The BRI investment in Djibouti has also been criticized for not bringing many benefits to the local population, and some observers have noted that China's enthusiasm for large infrastructure projects in Djibouti may be cooling, as some are taking longer than expected to pay off.

The latter would allow them to settle transactions without needing to convert their currency into US dollars. Finally, the fourth agreement set the framework for strategic cooperation to make Djibouti a regional banking and financial center, and it would allow Chinese banks to operate there. The Chinese news agency Xinhua explicitly linked these agreements, particularly the agreement regarding transshipment and redistribution and the agreement on banking and financial services, to the development of China's New Silk Road."

Aside from these, the government-to-government agreements as between Djibouti and China appear to be MOUs. These do not appear to be legally binding.[13] However, as some commentators have pointed out, these agreements could be used by China as diplomatic tools to insist that agreements have been reached over certain areas.[14]"

This fact has led to reports that China was taking over the Doraleh Container Terminal, and DP World has sued China Merchants Group for allegedly inducing the breach of contract.[72] In remarks delivered at the Heritage Foundation in December 2018, US National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed \"soon, Djibouti may hand over control of the Doraleh Container Terminal, a strategically-located shipping port on the Red Sea, to Chinese state-owned enterprises.\"[73]"

For example, in 2017, there were plans to construct a new deep-water port at El Hamdania in Cherchell, with US$900 million of the financing coming from a 20-year loan from the African Development Bank and the remainder from a consortium of Chinese banks. China Harbor Engineering was supposed to manage the port's operations for the first 25 years. However, work on the project was suspended in April 2019 because of the Hirak protest movement that caused the resignation of Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In July 2020, after a new government took over, it decided to reach out to China to resume work on the El Hamdania Port project.[62]"

Chief among them is that the Exim Bank reportedly inserted a confidentiality clause into the loan agreement, which shielded its terms from public scrutiny until it was too late to stop or alter them. Another major challenge was the cost of the project. Kenya had a number of options (including rehabilitating an old line and refurbishing it with the same or different gauge), but it opted for the most expensive option of building a new line. Another challenge, related to the cost of the project, is the use of the Mombasa port, a key national asset, as collateral for the project and the waiving of sovereign immunity, exposing the port to a potential takeover by the Chinese. The fact that Kenya continues to struggle to generate enough revenue from the line to service its debt has exacerbated the problem, so much so that a recent parliamentary committee report called for renegotiation of the terms of the loan with China. Other challenges to the project include corruption; an arbitration clause in the loan agreement making the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) the final and binding arbiter of any and all disputes between the Exim Bank and Kenya; and ecosystem degradation, fragmentation and destruction."

When Kenya awarded CRBC the contract to build the SGR, it did so without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010 Constitution and the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. The Act permits the government to bypass its provisions if doing so is part of a negotiated grant or loan agreement, which the government claimed was the case here. In a 2020 decision, in response to a legal challenge brought in 2014, the Court of Appeal held that the engagement of CRBC was not an obligation arising out of a negotiated grant or loan agreement, and thus violated the Constitution and the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. In 2014, Kenya issued local content rules requiring foreign firms to subcontract or enter into joint ventures with local persons for at least \\(30\\%\\) of the value of a contract they win. However, this law did not take effect until 2016. Although Kenya made a gentlemen's agreement that CRBC would use local content for \\(40\\%\\) of its needs for the SGR, with the exception of its cement needs, a number of factors made this difficult to achieve."

A government report noted that the line registered a loss of over US$200 million over three years, a loss that, due to the manner in which the financing is structured, taxpayers have to cover.[108] This has made it difficult for Kenya to cover the operational cost and service its debt.[109]"

Organized pressure by Kenyan cement manufacturers directed to the President successfully resulted in the reversal of a previous agreement with Chinese stakeholders to import cement from China. All the cement used for the project was subsequently purchased from Kenyan cement industries. Some of the construction services (slope protection, drainage works, supplies, vehicle hire), as well as the telecom, banking, and other services to the contractors and their camps, were also sourced locally. However, CRBC has had to cope with frequent lack of capacity among local providers. The managing director of Kenya Rail reported in a meeting with representatives of Kenya's private sector association that many local companies were unable to honor contracts to term and that many laborers \"run away after a week or two,\" forcing the CRBC to sign short-term trial contracts. Yet, Kenyan cement producers are still among the few local manufacturers supplying materials to the SGR. Steel parts like the rails, railway engines, construction machines, and many other products that cannot currently be produced in Kenya are shipped in from China.[133]"

However, Malaysia has maintained its overall involvement and support for the BRI and for Chinese investment in various sectors. Accusations that China has been involved in \"debt-trap diplomacy\" in Malaysia have been disputed by several commentators, who note the influence of domestic interests, politics, and agency with respect to BRI-linked projects. Studies on media and public sentiment in Malaysia with respect to the BRI have indicated generally positive views, with support for cautious involvement and awareness of some of the challenges and opportunities on the part of Malaysian businesses."

This shift has led to a higher emphasis on localization and on prioritizing high-tech investments to develop Malaysia as one of the digital and automation hubs in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the country is increasingly turning down investments related to polluting industries while implementing stricter environmental requirements and providing incentives for green FDI. The Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Investment (MITI) established the Belt and Road Initiative National Secretariat (BRINS) right after the signing of the BRI Memorandum of Understanding between Malaysia and China. In 2019, BRINS was renamed China Section to reflect better the work of the department, which also encompasses other non-BRI related bilateral matters.[39]"

Some projects are not strictly speaking \"investment,\" rather the Chinese companies only won the construction contracts, although not always under the most transparent manner. Hence, the tendency by certain foreign and domestic media alike to lump together all these projects as if they're all the same and constitutive components of a strategically designed \"debt-trap\" diplomacy by China is misleading."

Mahathir went further, saying: 'We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries'. Such an announcement made international news, but several interviewees made the point that Mahathir's intention behind the bold announcement was more nuanced, with him wanting to re-negotiate the terms of the original project rather than cancelling it outright."

CCCC had originally insisted the project went on or 22 billion Malaysian ringgits worth of compensation and penalty be paid to it if the Malaysian side unilaterally terminated the ECRL (TODAY, 2018). It also refused to recognise the ECRL as a G2G project, claiming that it was a purely business-to-business undertaking. CCCC also turned down Malaysia's offer of railway re-routing as the company was wary of losing money (or earning less than initial projections) out of the project (Malgeri, 2019). The apparent upper hand of CCC over Malaysia was confirmed by Daim Zainuddin, special envoy of Mahathir for the purpose of re-negotiations: 'There is a binding agreement . . . it may be one sided, but it is equally binding [on Malaysia]. . . . If you are silly enough to sign the agreement, then it's your problem' (Jaipragas, 2019)."

Clearly, China's central authorities realised that its global ambitions would be thwarted if the international community took the ECRL as a positive example of Chinese 'debt trap diplomacy'. At the time, the 'debt trap diplomacy' narrative was gaining momentum after the opposition parties in several developing countries (such as Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Maldives) came to power by attacking their respective incumbents for a perceived over-friendliness to the BRI and accusations of them being captured by Chinese financial largess (Malgeri, 2019). The NDRC moved to prevent further escalations, especially when President Xi Jinping was to host the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in late April 2019. Expecting the attendance of important national leaders and international economic organisations, the Chinese national leadership and the NDRC saw in Mahathir an influential, senior political figure in the developing world and Muslim community. As an 'old friend' since at least the 1980s, Mahathir has consistently championed China's growing role in the international arena and Asian regionalism (Khoo, 2019). Therefore, a rapprochement with Malaysia would have sent the perfect signal, showing how China was receptive to international concerns and keen on supplying win-win solutions and common prosperity. This recalibration also meat [sic] that pressure was applied from the highest echelons of the Chinese national government on CCCC whose commercial interests eventually yielded to national foreign policy goals in the end (Malgeri, 2019)."

Among other changes, the construction cost was reduced from 55 billion to 44 billion Malaysian ringgits. In addition to reducing the principal repayment amount, this would also lighten the financing interest payment. The railway track was also re-routed, passing through five states (Negri Sembilan added to Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Selangor) and Putrajaya rather than the previous four states, allowing more states to access the economic benefits of the improved deal. For CCCC, while it has been retained as the main contractor, it now has a longer-term stake in the project after agreeing to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a 50/50 joint venture arrangement"

Projects are divided into three timeframes, Phase I (2017-2020), Phase II (2020-2025), and Phase III (2025-2030).

Pakistan borders China's Xinjiang Province in the north, which \"provides China with a potential corridor through the Karakoram Highway to the seaport at Gwadar in Baluchistan on the Indian Ocean.\"4 The Pakistan part of the BRI is called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has been described as the BRI's flagship project. The plans for establishing an economic corridor between Pakistan and China appear to have preceded the BRI.5 The project was first announced in 2013, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party met Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang in Beijing. The emphasis was on \"connecting China with the Chinese-invested Pakistani port of Gwadar through highway, rail and pipeline infrastructure.\"6"

The Chinese CPEC authorities nominate three Chinese firms for bidding purposes. Procuring entities then issue the bidding documents to the three nominated Chinese contractors, seeking bids for the contract. Contracts make allowance for domestic contractors to collaborate with Chinese counterparts via joint ventures. The processes used during the initial selection of the three Chinese contractors were not known, impeding an assessment of the extent to which possibilities for collusive practices are controlled for in the process of selecting the winning contractor. The feasibility of domestic construction firms being able to obtain subcontracting work is left to the Chinese contractors, and the extent to which the government of Pakistan is willing and able to pursue \"local content\" objectives when negotiating BRI projects. The CPEC agreement between Pakistan and China allows for sub-contracting up to a maximum of \\(30\\%\\) of the contract value, subject to the procuring entity's agreement. The perception of interviewees is that Chinese contractors use their own labor and that BRI procurement contracts are not very helpful in providing employment opportunities within the country. This is consistent with other assessments that even if local capacity exists, Chinese labor and equipment are generally used for BRI projects.[99]"

Discussion of CPEC has consistently been characterized by a major gap between the facts on the ground and how it is described. Even some of the best, and most thoughtful experts continue to use figures that have long lost their connection to reality. The BRI meta-narrative casts a long shadow over whichever specific case is being examined, whether it be lines drawn on maps across Asia, superlative numbers, dual-use ports, debt traps, and other tropes. In the case of Pakistan, some of these framings have been misleading. The \"corridor\" concept and transportation routes from Xinjiang to Gwadar have been a consistent, distracting focal point from the nature of the investments that have been made. Rumors of large-scale debt distress – which are founded in several other BRI cases – have not been fully borne out by the facts. There continues to be more interest on the part of many outside observers in potential dual-use facilities at a barely functional port than out-and-out military cooperation taking place in plain sight.[139]"

Facing a \"persistent balance of payment (BOP) crisis,\" the government \"had to look for various avenues to obtain foreign currency inflows.\" Leasing the port \"was one of the ways to increase the country's foreign reserves.\"[144] In 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) \"became the majority shareholder in a joint venture with Sri Lanka Ports Authority that holds a concession to develop and operate the port for 99 years. CMPH paid the Sri Lanka Ports Authority $1.12 billion for the joint venture stake.\"[145]"

The port will benefit the local area directly and indirectly. Once operational, it will generate $500 million USD annually, create training programs for community members on ports, support a more diverse local economy by consistently bringing in foreign business, and create thousands of jobs. This economic benefit, specifically the creation of 3,500 direct jobs and 5,700 indirect jobs during construction, is desperately needed in the region after the closing of the oil refinery. However, there is skepticism that the port will not generate the jobs that CHEC has announced for locals, due to the trend of importing Chinese laborers for large infrastructure construction associated with BRI, which is already occurring elsewhere in Trinidad and Tobago."

However, despite the September 2018 agreement and the announced plans, our most recent imagery from late May 2020 shows that no construction has occurred, not even the beginning stages of land reclamation. The project has been further delayed by COVID-19 halting all foreign investment occurring in the spring of 2020. The indefinite delay of the project emphasizes how Trinidad and Tobago cannot build the port and bring business to the economically struggling La Brea area without Chinese aid. It appears that either the port is not a priority to the BRI or there are unpublicized reasons for its delay, as CHEC has continued to push"

Critics argue the New Eurasian Land Bridge Economic Corridor appears to be largely political in nature, and is aimed at providing an alternative supply route for Chinese goods if China were to face increased pressure on maritime routes.[58] Also, the new route would help develop adjacent Chinese regions, which are far from coastal shipping ports, and otherwise would demand robust investments in Chinese infrastructure, linking more developed coastal parts with inland provinces. An economic justification is that air transportation of the same goods would cost much more, while the delivery time through the routes, two to three weeks, is significantly shorter than through traditional sea routes.[59]"

The establishment of the CMREC is considered a promising step toward regional connectivity and economic development in Eurasia through the territory of Mongolia; the Mongolian initiative fits easily with China's goals for the BRI, and matches Russia's desire for active involvement in the project. Mongolia's vision for the CMREC is much more than a mere transit zone between China and Russia.[62] At present, 32 projects covered by the CMREC are being implemented.[63]"

When officials were considering bids on the project, the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan reportedly put pressure on Kyrgyzstan's Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recommending a Chinese company, TBEA, as the sole contractor for the project, and hinting that a loan from China to the Kyrgyzstan government was linked to that selection. Consequently, a more experienced contractor, Russia's Inter RAO, was passed over, as was another Chinese contractor, China Machinery Engineering Corporation. The unsuccessful modernization implemented by TBEA resulted in a breakdown in January 2018 that left a large part of the Kyrgyz capital without heating and electricity during bitterly cold weather.[104] The failure of the heating and power plant was interpreted by local media as the result of China's \"neo-colonialism\" in Central Asia.[105]"

The directorate of the Naryn free economic zone planned to allot 170 hectares of land for 49 years for the construction of a complex of warehouses, terminals, hotels, catering enterprises and a gas station. Hundreds of locals held a series of protests, claiming the project was a \"land grab\" by China and demanding that the project be cancelled. In order to avoid a conflict, in mid-February the Chinese investor decided to terminate the project and sent a letter to the government of Kyrgyzstan demanding the return of about US$600,000 paid earlier.[127]"

In recent years, the BRI has also focused on public health, the digital economy, green development, and other new forms of infrastructure. Most projects in the region have involved a partnership with local companies or joint ventures as part of their involvement in the BRI. Concerns and criticisms of the BRI in Latin America involve the inefficient legal frameworks, regulatory risks, lack of transparency, China's geopolitical interests, and the effect on domestic political issues."

COSCO's interest in the Port of Piraeus began in 2008 when a subsidiary of COSCO won a 35-year concession to operate one of the port's container terminals, which became the Piraeus Container Terminal (PCT). Following the concession, PCT became one of the fastest-growing container terminals in Europe, and in 2019, it became Europe's fourth busiest container terminal in terms of total container throughput. In 2016, COSCO acquired a majority stake in the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), which manages all other operations in the Port of Piraeus, including passenger and car terminals, and an additional container terminal. The apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have attracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors in Greece. The commercial success of Piraeus under COSCO management notwithstanding, there appears to have been some resistance from Greek political leadership and labor groups to the initial concession and subsequent acquisition of the OLP by COSCO. The initial concession agreement was also the subject of proceedings before the European Commission, which found that certain provisions thereof constitute unlawful state aid under European Union law."

Compared to sea routes from China that use the large northern European ports, this route has a relative advantage in terms of travel time: The travel time of a container ship from Shanghai to Piraeus appear to be approximately 22 days, which is 10 days less than the time the ship must sail to a northern European port such as Rotterdam or Hamburg."

Under the agreement, PCT is expected to a pay nominal sum of approximately €4.3 billion (about US$5 billion) in rent over the 35-year period, which consists of an initial lump sum payment of €50 million (about US$59 million) and periodic payments of a percentage of consolidated revenues plus lease cost calculated based on pier surface area and quay length.[16] The concession agreement, which technically was between the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), PCT, and COSCO Pacific, was finalized in November 2008 and approved by the Greek parliament in March 2009, whereupon the management of Pier II was transferred to PCT.[17]"

Currently, as at the time of the 2009 concession, the entire Port of Piraeus, including container, car, and passenger terminals, ship repair bases, and the surrounding land estate, is leased by the Greek state to the OLP under a 45-year concession agreement signed in 2002 (amended later to increase the concession period from 40 years to 45 years for the purpose of accommodating the COSCO concession). Before the incorporation of the OLP in 1999 as a public company listed in the Athens Stock Exchange, the port was under public management. The OLP was fully state owned until 2016, when a majority stake was sold to COSCO Shipping. For an overview of the port's management before the concession and the creation of the OLP, see Psaraftis & Pallis, supra note 14, at 29-34."

On the same date as Prime Minister Bettel and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signed the MOU regarding the BRI, four agreements were signed by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Clearing House, and the Bank of China. While these agreements do not appear to be publicly available, reports indicate that the agreements between the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges aim to use Luxembourg's expertise in the field of green finance to help China's energy transition. Meanwhile, the agreement with the Shanghai Clearing House would allow the Luxembourg Stock Exchange to connect the Grand Duchy to the Chinese"

It is involved in the BRI by encouraging UK companies to finance these projects, and it is working to ensure the economic interests of the UK are not left behind and that any participation is structured in a way that does not contravene the UK's strategic interests."

These include the risk that Chinese investment will encourage countries to strike deals that undermine international standards that the UK seeks to promote, or that leave countries with unsustainable debt that undermines development and political stability. There is also a risk that the promise of Chinese investment, or the coercive leverage of indebtedness to China, could encourage countries to join China's efforts to undermine certain aspects of the rules-based international system, and could weaken the alliances and partnerships that help preserve international peace and prosperity. We therefore commend the Government's decision not to sign a Memorandum of Understanding in support of the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of these risks. Further, the Government is right not to accede to China's request for the UK to give what would be in effect a blanket endorsement of a key pillar of its foreign policy.[30]"

                "content": "The UK has been engaging with China regarding sustainable financing of BRI projects, but there do not appear to be any major flagship projects. Engagement with China and the BRI has been occurring despite a deterioration in UK-China relations, which has been described by the government as a reset and by others as a breakdown.[67] The deterioration has been attributed to a combination of factors. Concern over Chinese company Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G cell phone network and over China's treatment of Hong Kong, once a former UK territory for which the UK passed sovereignty to the Chinese in 1997. These issues, combined with frustrations over China's lack of transparency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the UK's belief that China has been engaging in human rights abuses in the Western Province of Xinjiang have been notable causes in the decline in relations.[68]"

One example cited was the construction of pipelines that led to the forcible displacement of populations and the use of the military to protect investments.[70] The Overseas Development Institute has expressed apprehension over the engagement of the BRI in fragile countries, claiming that it \"could make fragile situations worse by failing to consider local conflict dynamics.\"[71]"
