While there are some differing rules between the two houses, in general, committees may be standing (usually appointed at the start of a parliament and continuing until the end of that parliament) or select (cease to exist once a final report is presented). There are also joint committees and statutory committees. Debate is ongoing over whether the subject matter of committee inquiries is limited to the areas of legislative power provided to the Parliament under the Australian Constitution. The sub judge convention, whereby restrictions are imposed on parliamentary activity with regard to matters awaiting adjudication in a court of law, may lead to certain evidence being taken in camera, but does not restrain the ability of a committee to inquire into a matter."

Inquiry committees are a form of ad hoc committees and are established to inquire into a particular issue and report back to the requesting house of Parliament. The work of these Committees is by and large regulated by the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the particular house, directions of the speaker/chairman of the house, and other parliamentary practices and conventions. Committees may be constituted or established by provisions of the Rules of Procedure of a particular house, upon a motion or resolution adopted by a house, by the authority of the Presiding officers (speaker/chairman), or by an Act of Parliament. Committees appear to have limited powers to call for documents and witnesses. Under the procedural rules of the lower house (the Lok Sabha), committees have the power to take evidence; request documents, papers, and records; and summon persons. Report findings are typically published and submitted in the relevant house; such findings appear to be recommendations and are not binding, but can be influential and help shape public debate and discussion."

Because investigative power belongs to each of the Houses, they could not authorize the Committee to directly utilize it. Upon request of the Committee, the Houses used their investigative power in place of the Committee.[23] The meetings were open to the public in principle.[24] The Committee could make them closed-door, and in such cases some parts of the record of proceedings could be kept secret.[25]"

Parliament exercises oversight over the executive body through committees. These include portfolio committees, select committees, public accounts committees, ad hoc committees, and joint committees. Under the Constitution and parliamentary rules, committees conduct investigations on behalf of Parliament and report their findings for debate and action. In doing so, they are accorded various authorities, including the power to summon anyone as a witnesses and to require the production of documents. Failure to appear before a committee without a good cause or failure to provide satisfactory answers to questions posed by them is a prosecutable offense. Although committee meetings and their work products are generally open to the public, they may close their sessions and restrict access to their work products in certain circumstances. Assembly, council, and joint rules bar members from discussing matters pending before a court."

Parliamentary inquiry is the main procedure at the disposal of members of parliament to conduct in-depth research and examinations of matters that are of interest to the political and legislative process. Parliamentary inquiries are conducted by ad hoc committees of inquiry that are formed and mandated specifically to examine the subject matter of the parliamentary inquiry and prepare a report that is then debated in a plenary session. Minutes of the committees and their final reports are published and publicly available. Committees of inquiry have the power to request information from public and private parties, however, they lack the power to compel persons to testify or disclose information. The mandates of committees of inquiry must be of a limited term, and state secrets and trade secrets cannot be the subject matter of inquiry. The Parliament is also forbidden by the Constitution from launching a parliamentary inquiry into a subject that is directly relevant to the judiciary's use of its powers in an ongoing case. Apart from ad hoc committees of inquiry, the standing Committee for the Examination of Human Rights has investigative powers similar to committees of inquiry in the field of human rights practices and complaints. Individual members of parliament may use their right of inquiry through the procedure of a written question, which is a formal inquiry about actions of the executive branch that the respondent presidential deputy or minister must answer in 15 days."

Parliamentary investigation committees may be established by a vote of three fifths of the total number of MPs for the investigation of the President for crimes that would bar the incumbent from holding the office, and the majority of the total number of MPs for investigating presidential deputies and ministers for crimes that are related to their duties.<sup>8</sup> Upon the completion of the parliamentary investigation committee's report, a plenary session holds a debate and may decide, by a vote of two thirds of the total number of MPs, to submit the subject of the investigation for trial before the Constitutional Court, which acts as the Supreme Criminal Tribunal.<sup>9</sup>"
