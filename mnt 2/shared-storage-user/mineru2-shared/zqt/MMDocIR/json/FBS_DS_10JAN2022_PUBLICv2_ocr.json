The FBS establishes performance indicators and milestones, which measure progress toward achieving strategic goals, inform future resource allocation, and ensure accountability of all programs and individuals. In addition, DS reviewed and analyzed existing policy, mission requirements, existing national and department policies and strategies, and the DS FY 2018-2022 FBS to identify where the Bureau should focus in the future. DS reviewed Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) congressional reports, and the Department Strategic Resource Themes to ensure alignment of the FBS with the broader strategy of Department and U.S. government priorities. The FBS will be used as a leadership tool to communicate DS' broader vision, mission, and strategic direction, and to help align program activities to budget requests."

The Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC) became operational in 2019, enabling the Department to conduct training efficiently and effectively for a diverse population of students each year. Moving forward, the Bureau will maximize training outcomes, building on past successes, by expanding training offerings and further increasing service delivery efficiencies. DS must also continue to adapt training to ensure operational readiness of Department personnel and others in the foreign affairs community, supporting the long-term resiliency of the Bureau and its mission. This goal aligns to the Department Strategic Resource themes: build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce; securing and protecting personnel, facilities, and information; and modernizing information technology (IT), data, and mobility. This goal aligns to Joint Strategic Plan Goal 4: Revitalize the diplomatic and development workforce and institutions, and Goal 5: Serve U.S. citizens around the world and facilitate secure international travel."

Without an emphasis on tracking statistics and focusing on diversity and inclusion initiatives, DS risks perpetuating an inaccurate representation of the United States and losing the asset of diverse viewpoints and experiences to drive progress. To mitigate this potential risk, DS needs to focus on recruitment, hiring, and retention of a skilled and diverse workforce."
