Early NER systems were based on handcrafted rules, lexicons, orthographic features and ontologies. These systems were followed by NER systems based on feature-engineering and machine learning (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). Starting with Collobert et al. (2011), neural network NER systems with minimal feature engineering have become popular. Such models are appealing because they typically do not require domain specific resources like lexicons or ontologies, and are thus poised to be more domain independent. Various neural architectures have been proposed, mostly based on some form of recurrent neural networks (RNN) over characters, sub-words and/or word embeddings."

We show in Table 1 and Table 2 and discuss in Section 7 how neural NER systems have improved performance over past works including supervised, semi-supervised, and knowledge based NER systems. For example, NN models on news corpora improved the previous state-of-the-art by \\(1.59\\%\\) in Spanish, \\(2.34\\%\\) in German, \\(0.36\\%\\) in English, and \\(0.14\\%\\), in Dutch, without any external resources or feature engineering. We provide resources, including links to shared tasks on NER, and links to the code for each category of NER system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey focusing on neural architectures for NER, and comparing to previous feature-based systems."
