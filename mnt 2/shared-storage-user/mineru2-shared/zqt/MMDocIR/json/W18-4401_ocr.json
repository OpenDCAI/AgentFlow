The task was to develop a classifier that could discriminate between Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive, and Non-aggressive texts. For this task, the participants were provided with a dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments each in Hindi (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English for training and validation. For testing, two different sets - one from Facebook and another from a different social media - were provided. A total of 130 teams registered to participate in the task, 30 teams submitted their test runs, and finally 20 teams also sent their system description paper which are included in the TRAC workshop proceedings. The best system obtained a weighted F-score of 0.64 for both Hindi and English on the Facebook test sets, while the best scores on the surprise set were 0.60 and 0.50 for English and Hindi respectively. The results presented in this report depict how challenging the task is. The positive response from the community and the great levels of participation in the first edition of this shared task also highlights the interest in this topic."

Now any information online has the power to reach billions of people within a matter of seconds. This has resulted in not only positive exchange of ideas but has also lead to a widespread dissemination of aggressive and potentially harmful content over the web. While most of the potentially harmful incidents like bullying or hate speech have predated the Internet, the reach and extent of Internet has given these incidents an unprecedented power and influence to affect the lives of billions of people. It has been reported that these incidents have not only created mental and psychological agony to the users of the web but has in fact forced people to deactivate their accounts and in extreme cases also commit suicides (Hinduja and Patchin, 2010). Thus the incidents of aggression and unratified verbal behaviour have not remained a minor nuisance, but have acquired the form of a major criminal activity that affects a large number of people. It is therefore important that preventive measures can be taken to cope with abusive behaviour aggression online."

Moreover, it has also resulted in duplication of research, to certain extent, and a certain kind of lack of focus and reusability of datasets across different strands of research.

So, trolling is intended \"to cause disruption and/or to trigger or exacerbate conflict for the purposes of their own amusement\" (Hardaker, 2010).

They propose 2 scales on which abusive language could be categorised - the target of the abuse (an individual or a group) and the nature of the language (explicit or implicit). Our classification of aggression into overt and covert aggression is largely similar to the explicit-implicit distinction. However, we make a more detailed distinction in relation to the target of the abuse (Kumar et al., 2018b) and it is not made along the axis of individual vs. group. This is so because we noticed in a large number of instances both individuals and groups are simultaneously targeted - in such cases individuals are targeted as members of certain groups or the individuals' actions were considered those of the group and became the locus of attack. As such it was not feasible to distinguish between the individual and group attack in lot of instances while annotating the dataset. The distinction that we made was related to the \"locus\" of attack and included such targets as gender, religion, caste, country of origin, race, etc. This classification, on the one hand, gave scope for focusing on different kinds of attack (for example, racial attacks or communal attacks) and, on the other hand, each of these targets may actually be attacked using a different set of vocabulary, thereby, making these more natural classes that could be classified using the surface-level linguistic features. Of course, it cannot be denied that these targets are not mutually exclusive and, as such, it makes the problem not just a multi-class classification problem but also multi-label classification problem. In addition to this, we also make use of a different terminol-"

Initially, the dataset was not released publicly but was emailed only to the registered participants. After the 6 weeks of release of train and dev sets, the test set was released and the participants had 5 days to test and upload their system. The complete timeline of the shared task is given in Table 1. We made use of CodaLab \\( {}^{1} \\) for the evaluation. Each team was allowed to submit up to 3 systems for evaluation.

The lexicon is obtained by automatic translation from an handmade lexicon of offensive words in Italian, with minimal human supervision. The original words are expanded into a list of their senses. The senses are manually annotated to filter out senses that are never used in an offensive context. Finally, all the lemmas of the remaining senses are generated with BabelNet in \\(50+\\) languages. The words in the lexicon are divided in those translating sense that can be used in an offensive context (but not necessarily are) and words translating senses that are directly offensive. This distinction is mapped to the Overtly Aggressive and Covertly Aggressive classes respectively. The classification of sentences is straightforward: a sentence that does not contain any word from the lexicon is tagged as NAG, a sentence containing more directly offensive words than potentially offensive words is tagged as OAG, and the other cases are tagged as CAG."

Moreover, the performance of the neural networks-based systems as well as the other approaches do not seem to differ much. If the features are carefully selected then classifiers like SVM and even random forest and logistic regression perform at par with deep neural networks. On the other hand, we find quite a few neural networks-based systems not performing quite well in the task. Nonetheless, 14 systems were trained using one or the other architectures of deep neural networks - either solely or as part of an ensemble. Moreover, 8 systems out of the top 15 are trained on neural networks, which shows the efficacy of the approach but at the same time does not rule out the usefulness and relevance of linear models for the task. There was only one system, Unito, that made use of a lexicon-based approach to solve the task. A few participants of the task pointed out the apparent \"inconsistencies\" in the annotation. It points towards the need to get the annotations validated by multiple human annotators."
