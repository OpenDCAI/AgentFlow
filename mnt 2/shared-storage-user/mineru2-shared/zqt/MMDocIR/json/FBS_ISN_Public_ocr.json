ISN will respond to that mandate, as outlined in this Strategy."

The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance is responsible for the third norm, the Chemical Weapons Convention. The regime is put at risk by: chemical and biological weapons development and use; Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions; and challenges by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia to U.S. and Western leadership and the current rules-based international order. The peaceful use of nuclear energy and technology provides benefits to millions around the world, especially in the face of climate change, but it must be developed and used with the highest safety, security, and nonproliferation standards. ISN works to promote nuclear cooperation with key allies and partners based on those standards. We must also ensure the continued effectiveness of the International Atomic Energy Agency and strengthen its global nuclear safeguards regime that serves as the verification arm of the NPT."

While biological safety and security, and countering biological terrorism, have always been part of ISN's focus, we must respond to the pandemic's wake-up call and give urgent attention to preventing access to, and acquisition of, biological agents by malign actors, and improve international capabilities to respond to a biological terrorism act. Countering biological threats is therefore our second Strategic Goal. Ironically, this task has been complicated by the world's frenzied response to the pandemic. For example, more high containment laboratories are being built and many thousands of mobile labs have been set up to handle samples, at times without regard to high biosafety and biosecurity standards; and much advanced research on viruses and related issues has been shared in the public domain, often without security oversight."

Strengthening nuclear nonproliferation makes all states more secure and provides the foundation for progress on nuclear disarmament and cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in accordance with NPT provisions and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards requirements. This foundational bargain has been challenged by North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and by Iran's provocative nuclear posture, including its failure to provide the IAEA the necessary cooperation to resolve IAEA concerns related to possible undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, as required by Iran's NPT-related Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. ISN is undertaking several initiatives to bolster international support for the NPT. The Tenth NPT Review Conference, originally scheduled for April 2020, has been repeatedly postponed due to the COVID pandemic; we hope it will be rescheduled later in 2022. It is important to ensure that the IAEA has the resources and authorities to carry out its missions, especially regarding nuclear safeguards to verify NPT nonproliferation obligations. ISN urges all NPT Parties who have not yet done so to adopt the IAEA Additional Protocol. ISN will have a leading role as Australia, the United Kingdom, and"

ISN also seeks to improve cooperation with moderate Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries and those that generally support NAM positions to better enable progress in multilateral nonproliferation treaties and agreements, increase consensus on nonproliferation norms and issues, and enhance partner capacity to prevent WMD proliferation. For example, we have productive dialogues with Brazil, Chile, India, Malaysia, and Peru, seek to engage Mexico and Ghana, and aim to re-engage with South Africa. Another ISN focus of attention is dealing with strategic stability among nuclear-armed states, most particularly, between India and Pakistan, both through government-to-government consultations and informal forums where discussion is more candid."

The United States concludes formal civil nuclear cooperation agreements (\"123 agreements\") in accordance with Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. These 123 agreements require partners to adhere to a set of nonproliferation obligations in order to receive U.S. nuclear material and equipment for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Given the substantial time, resources, and political commitment to conclude a 123 agreement, and the severe loss of market share by the U.S. nuclear industry in recent decades, ISN, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, created the less formal Nuclear Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding (NCMOU). This instrument allows the United States to engage with additional partners as a first step toward achieving our foreign policy goals while building nuclear nonproliferation norms. To strengthen nuclear nonproliferation and security norms through capacity-building and engagement, ISN also created the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program and now leads this U.S. interagency effort. FIRST engagement strengthens the capacity of partner countries to prioritize nuclear nonproliferation and security from the outset in technology selection. This Objective supports JSP Objectives 1.4 and indirectly 2.3."

ISN uses both its diplomatic leadership role and capacity-building programs to counter biological threats. The heightened awareness of biological threats engendered by the pandemic presents a special opportunity to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the global norm banning biological weapons, and reinvigorate international norm-setting around biological activities with dual-use potential. ISN is working to improve the UN Secretary- General's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), strengthen governance and oversight of dual-use life sciences research and high containment biological laboratories, and encourage transparency and information-sharing about disease outbreaks."

The PRC exploits its global relationships to acquire advanced and emerging technologies, including for diversion to military programs, making it nearly impossible to be assured that science and technology collaboration is not driving military progress in the PRC. These actions undermine the norms that make possible open innovation and collaboration, as well as the competitiveness of American workers, researchers, and companies. Meanwhile, Russia threatens its neighbors with often remarkable directness, and uses transfers of advanced weaponry and associated technology to develop dependency among its clients, establish strategic relationships, and spread asymmetric military capabilities that can threaten U.S. interests. The PRC and Russia often work to diminish the effectiveness of international institutions from the inside, through obstruction and countering U.S. initiatives. To address these threats, ISN leads with diplomacy, prioritizing collaboration with our partners and allies to take coordinated action against these malign activities, to include engaging our partners to build their resilience against exploitation and proliferation threats and the resilience of sensitive supply chains. ISN plays an important role in the interagency and multilateral system in helping set the norms and standards that govern dual use technologies, and imposing costs on those who break the rules. ISN also has the important responsibility of implementing statutory and discretionary sanctions authorities and undertaking in other actions to counter Russian and PRC activities that threaten U.S. interests, to include implementation of Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanction Act (CAATSA)."

However, the PRC remains reliant on the international science and technology ecosystem. As such, it takes advantage of the international rules-based order and uses international collaboration to coopt emerging technologies for the fulfillment of the PRC's goals. It does so through both licit and illicit means, involving trade, investment, join research and development, and academic collaboration, as well as through intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. These tactics undermine the rules the international community relies on to ensure that dual-use technologies are not inappropriately diverted to military end uses, and they challenge the ability of rule-abiding governments to protect their own intellectual property, companies, and individual workers. The PRC's efforts directly threaten the integrity of international"

This work includes preventing proliferation into and from North Korea linked to its illicit programs and ensuring that partners have the capacity needed to do the same. We also continue to bolster existing security frameworks and arrangements, including ASEAN and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). From 2022 through 2024, the United States will co-chair, with Sri Lanka and Thailand, the ARF's Intersessional Meeting on Nonproliferation and Disarmament, a venue through which ARF participants can share views on developments impacting nonproliferation and disarmament in the region, share best practices, and develop capacity collectively to meet common challenges. ISN also plays a central role in the implementation of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral arrangement to facilitate Australia's acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines to meet the 21st century strategic environment. Over the course of an 18-month period, ISN will lead efforts to ensure that the initiative is implemented in ways that promote global nuclear nonproliferation, as directed by President Biden. In South Asia, where the potential for conflict between nuclear-armed rivals remains high, ISN continues to engage bilaterally with relevant states to discourage further development of destabilizing capabilities and to promote restraint. In the Middle East, Iran's nuclear ambitions continue to pose a serious threat to regional security and U.S. interests in the region. These tensions further complicate broader nuclear diplomacy in the region, impacting decisions by other states over civil nuclear development and international efforts to ensure that nuclear developments are limited to purely peaceful purposes.

In this way, the regimes' work provides an effective basis for building broad consensus to take action to impede acquisition of WMD, their delivery systems, destabilizing conventional weapons, and related technologies. Each regime meets regularly, providing a platform for sharing information on proliferation trends, exchanging licensing and law enforcement best practices, and coordinating policies. The regimes promote implementation of Catch-all and Intangible Technology Transfer (ITT) controls to prevent transfers of uncontrolled emerging technology items to support the development or enhancement of military capabilities of U.S. strategic rivals. We also work with the regimes to broaden their impact beyond the participating governments, for example, by conducting regular outreach with non-members, industries and academia. ISN will continue to lead U.S. engagement with partners to coordinate their national export controls through multilateral export control regimes to stem proliferation of chemical, biological, nuclear, missile, and advanced conventional weapons goods and technologies. Through technical and policy consultations with regime members, ISN will promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of these and related dual-use items to support regional and international security and stability."

A key factor in global leadership is the inclusion of the widest possible group of partners in planning, actions, and programs to ensure a more complete understanding of the operating environment. To be most successful, this in turn requires a diverse and inclusive workforce in ISN, as well as ensuring our training and other programs promote diversity in our partners, so that they – and ISN – can be informed by and reach as many segments of a given population as possible."

Our assistance programs, enabled by the COVID-required use of on-line learning and remote platforms, have seen initial improvement in the diversity of the groups trained. Program managers will emphasize diversity in presenters and press for diverse trainees. We seek to build on this momentum to institutionalize our DEIA principles and practices. ISN must become – and is now becoming – a more diverse, agile, adaptive, resilient, and “expeditionary” bureau, able to respond creatively to emerging threats or unanticipated challenges."
