The United States is the world’s largest and most innovative economy, but retaining our preeminence requires constant vigilance to ensure that American companies and American workers can continue to compete and thrive in a rapidly changing global economy. As the United States integrates further with global trading partners, key risks to the American economy and our collective prosperity include disruptive technologies; intellectual property theft; the rise of authoritarian, state-led, and protectionist economic development models; and geopolitical tensions."

Additionally, CABDA mandates the establishment of a Trade Expansion Advisory Committee (TEAC) with select representatives of the U.S. private sector and other organizations, including labor organizations, to provide comment and advice on priorities for trade expansion. EB leverages its global reach through embassies to mobilize a whole-of-government approach to advancing U.S. economic and commercial interests and implement EB-led CABDA legislated mandates. The Department's commercial support efforts have historically focused on large companies with established government relations offices. While we continue to advocate for large firms who are major job creators, we have an opportunity to create awareness of the Office of Commercial and Business Affairs programs for Embassies to support exporters in the under-served communities and region, as well as mid-size companies. The EB Special Representative and CBA drives this outreach in partnership with industry associations, inter-government partners, and sub-national stakeholders.

The developing world faces a significant shortfall in investment in infrastructure, leading some countries to accept financing from countries with little regard for quality, life cycle costs, environmental and social impacts, debt sustainability, and long-term effects on diplomatic and commercial relationships. Assistance to make infrastructure projects economically viable while meeting high standards construction quality and sustainability will contribute to global economic recovery and open commercial opportunities for U.S. companies that specialize in quality infrastructure services and equipment. The Blue Dot Network (BDN) will give companies confidence a certified project meets those standards. This creates a number of natural incentives for private sector companies to join the initiative. EB, with USAID, strengthens countries capacities to evaluate projects and coordinates U.S. assistance and private-sector-led infrastructure investment through the Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN) and its associated Transaction Advisory Fund (TAF), which promotes transparency and levels the playing field for U.S. businesses. These efforts contribute to the free, fair, and reciprocal trade, open investment environments, and good governance goals under the Indo-Pacific strategy. EB, partnering with the Department of Commerce and other agencies including TDA, DFC, and EXIM, can work to better support U.S. business in competing for key opportunities in major markets.

EB leverages its global reach through embassies to mobilize a whole-of-government approach to advancing U.S. economic and commercial interests while making the public case for free, fair, and reciprocal trade. The United States is the world's largest and most innovative economy, but retaining our preeminence requires constant vigilance to ensure that American companies and American workers can continue to compete and thrive in a rapidly changing global economy. American exporters face a range of tariff and non-tariff barriers that limit the benefits of international trade, erode U.S. competitiveness in overseas markets, and undermine domestic political support for the international trading systems. Achieving free, fair, and reciprocal access for American goods and services abroad helps our companies to compete successfully, which directly supports American prosperity by creating jobs, attracting further investment, and generating tax revenues to finance infrastructure, education, and other public investments that can support sustained economic growth. EB will pursue this objective by identifying and promoting new opportunities for American exporters; by engaging trading partners bilaterally and through multilateral fora to identify and correct unfair trading practices; and by shaping the U.S. government's policy response to persistent unfair trading practices."

By ensuring that U.S. foreign and economic policy interests are well represented at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in IMF lending and technical assistance programs, we support the economic reforms critical to economic and political stability and the broad-based global economic growth needed to drive demand for U.S. products and services. By promoting fiscal transparency through issuance of the annual Fiscal Transparency Report and management of the Fiscal Transparency Innovation Fund, EB improves financial management and government accountability. This helps to level the playing field for U.S. business, increases market confidence, and reduces the costs of corruption that lowers economic growth, investment, and the tax revenues needed to fund health and education expenditures vital to broad-based economic growth and opportunity. By leveraging coordinated action in the Paris Club to resolve sovereign debt failures, we maximize repayment to U.S. taxpayers and promote economic stability for U.S. investors overseas. We also provide coordinated financial assistance with appropriate burden-sharing to the most vulnerable debtor nations, a key step to restore sustainable growth in those nations. Objective 2.1 supports the Department of State and USAID Joint Strategic Plan (JSP) Goal 2 (Promote global prosperity and shape an international environment in which the United States can thrive) and JSP Objective 2.1 (Economic Governance: Promote a global economy that creates opportunities for all Americans)."

By mandating that signatory countries criminalize bribery of foreign officials in international business transactions and creating a monitoring mechanism to ensure robust enforcement of those laws, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention has helped to establish an international approach to rooting out a global problem. Going forward, U.S. leadership and engagement in the OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB), which monitors compliance with the Convention, will continue to be crucial to strengthen the organization's effectiveness and advance U.S. interests. The United States should continue cooperating with the WGB to increase enforcement of bribery laws and seek to secure commitments by governments of key emerging economies to combat corruption. Contributing risk factors include the rise of authoritarian, state-led, and protectionist economic development models.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of supporting industry in improving the transparency, resiliency, adaptability, and diversity of their supply chains, making them more competitive and secure. EB will seek to make full use of the wide range of tools available under existing trade agreements to ensure a level playing field for U.S. companies, farmers, ranchers, and workers. Non-scientific regulatory barriers hold back innovation for U.S. farmers and ranchers and from advancing climate smart solutions to agriculture to address food security and value chains. Functioning markets are critical to global and national security. EB will also work with the interagency to identify opportunities to develop new tools to support these objectives, such as through the USTR-led Trade Task Force.

At the same time, the OECD can advance economic innovations and standards that facilitate new and emerging green and blue technologies. This objective captures how our success at OECD supports JSP Goal 2 to promote global prosperity and shape an international environment in which the United States can thrive. and JSP Strategic Objective 2.1 promoting a global economy that creates opportunities for all Americans and Strategic Objective 2.2: Support inclusive and sustainable economic growth and opportunity for communities around the globe. OECD directly contributes to Performance Goal 2.1.1: on international economic leadership.

Additionally, some countries may use investment screening for non-national security purposes, with the aim of protecting domestic industries or interests – potentially limiting business opportunities for U.S. companies."

Sanctions may be imposed across multiple geographic regions, against individuals and entities, and involve blocking access to the U.S. financial system, or constraining resources of adversaries and malign actors. With a commitment to multilateral engagement, we will also increase capacity and strengthen resilience of our partners and allies to deter aggression, coercion, and malign influence by state and non-state actors. The application of sanctions can also advance U.S. economic security by ensuring energy security and combating corruption. This objective supports JSP 1.4 and 2.3."

As the use of sanctions increases in response to national security concerns, the ability of EB to respond to demands will depend on our staffing levels, ability to deliver appropriate training and build expertise, and ability to secure necessary funding to support targeting research and international engagement. A significant external risk is the proliferation of technological innovations such as digital currencies, alternative payment platforms, and new ways of hiding cross-border transactions, all of which potentially reduce the efficacy of American sanctions. These technologies offer malign actors opportunities to hold and transfer funds outside the traditional financial system. They also empower our adversaries seeking to build new financial and payments systems intended to diminish the dollar's global role."

Coordination with regional bureaus remains vital to successfully implementing and amplifying economic policies and achieving the market-oriented economic reforms articulated in Joint Strategic Plan Objective 2.3. EB will empower EB's Regional Coordinators, who serve in a liaison position between the bureau and regional bureaus and develop joint economic strategies with regional bureaus. Promoting and increasing staff use of economic resources will result in a more efficient and effective workforce. A lack of access to and/or knowledge of technological solutions available to personnel constrain our work. Some staff are often unaware of existing resources such as Haver and Econ@State. EB personnel have uneven technology skills, hampering bureau-wide productivity. With improved access and training, EB could be more agile, ensuring it is well prepared to confront 21st century global challenges. Stakeholders include the Bunche librarians, E-Diplomacy, Department of Commerce Analytics section, and School of Professional Studies – Economic and Commercial Studies at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI). Quality economic analysis informs and improves policy decisions, both economic and broader strategic policy. It provides important context to social and political developments and quantifies effects. EB plays a central role in improving State's economic analysis by leveraging its own expertise and producing analytic products and by providing and encouraging officers to use economic data resources. One risk is that policy formulation will occur without the economic angle being fully considered, leading to a disempowering of economic staff throughout the State Department."
