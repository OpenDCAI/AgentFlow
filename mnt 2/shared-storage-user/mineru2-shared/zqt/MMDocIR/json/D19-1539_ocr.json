For the base model we sum the two representations and for the larger models they are concatenated. Keys and values are based on the forward and backward states fed to the attention module. In summary, this module has access to information about the entire input surrounding the current target token. During training, we predict every token in this way. The output of this module is fed to an output classifier which predicts the center token.

The same table also shows results for News Crawl which contains newswire data. This data generally performs less well than Common Crawl, even on MRPC which is newswire. A likely reason is that News Crawl examples are individual sentences of 23 words on average which compares to several sentences or 50 words on average for Common Crawl. Mutli-sentence training examples are more effective for end-tasks based on sentence pairs, e.g., there is a 14 point accuracy gap on RTE between News Crawl and Common Crawl with 4.5B tokens. More News Crawl data is most beneficial for CoLA and STS-B."

To reduce the effect of training on examples of different lengths, we adopted the following strategy: we concatenate all training examples into a single string and then crop blocks of 512 consecutive tokens from this string. We train on a batch of these blocks (BWiki - blck). It turns out that this strategy did not work better compared to our existing strategy of simply using the data as is (BWiki - sent). BooksCorpus and Wikipedia performs very well on QNLI and MNLI but less well on other tasks."
