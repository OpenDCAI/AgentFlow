Under Islamic law, the father is considered a child's natural guardian. However, under the rules of hizanat, or a mother's right to physical custody as established by Hanafi Muslim personal law, a mother has this right over her male child until the age of seven and over her female child until the child reaches puberty. It should be noted that the courts in Pakistan have at times deviated from Hanafi jurisprudential rules when it is in the best interest of the child."

However, there was an instance where the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan in Mst Asia Bibi v Alam Khan 27 maintained a view that a father was held liable for abduction his daughter from lawful custody of her maternal uncle and maternal grandfather. It could thus be stated that the law relating to child custody is uneven, and courts have demonstrated favour for the opinion that a parent couldn't be viewed an abductor of his child.[29]"
