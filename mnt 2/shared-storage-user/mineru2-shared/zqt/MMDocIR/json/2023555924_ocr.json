Local media in Iceland have reported several recent, nonfatal accidents involving school buses, generally related to weather conditions."

The rules for in-service vehicles are also largely harmonized through the implementation of the Heavy Vehicle National Law by most states and territories. Each state and territory may also set additional rules for school buses, including through contractual arrangements. In terms of safety features, new buses will be required to have Advanced Emergency Braking and Electronic Stability Control within the next year. Fire suppression systems are not required by law, but appear to be required under the school bus arrangements of some jurisdictions. Event data recorders are not required. Seat belts are not required by law for route service buses, including school buses, but some jurisdictions have moved to install them, particularly on school buses that service rural areas. There have been calls for expansion of the use of seat belts in light of recent bus accidents."

In some jurisdictions, school buses are procured and operated by the government, while in others bus operators are contracted to provide school bus services, or there may be a mix of both. In some cases, school buses are only provided in certain areas. For example, school buses in Western Australia are mainly operated in \"regional and remote\" areas and for students attending Education Support Facilities. In major metropolitan areas, students travel at a concession fare rate on regular public transport."
