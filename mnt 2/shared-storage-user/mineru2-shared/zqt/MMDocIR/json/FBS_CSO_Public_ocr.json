China and Russia capitalize on fragile states by gaining strategic access and exploiting weakness to shape future political outcomes against U.S. interests.

CSO's expertise focuses on three lines of effort that address different components of the conflict cycle: strategic prevention, conflict resolution, and security sector stabilization. These efforts include programs that: provide early warning for violent conflict and potential atrocities; offer technical support to peace process negotiations; encourage defections, de-radicalization, and re-integration of ex-combatants; inform Department efforts to engage and influence hybrid and non-state armed groups; and prevent the recruitment and radicalization of potential terrorists. CSO ensures that its programs are rigorously monitored and evaluated using evidence-based measures of effectiveness. In doing so, CSO plays a critical role in shaping how the Department effectively prevents and mitigates conflict."

Policy initiatives and legislative mandates include: the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability to implement Global Fragility Act of 2019 (GFA); the Stabilization Assistance Review (SAR); the White House-led interagency Atrocity Prevention Task Force (APTF) to advance the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018; the U.S. Women, Peace, and Security Strategy; Executive Order 14020 “Advancing Gender Equity and Equality”; the Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World”; the International Religious Freedom Act (1998); and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. CSO advances its policy priorities through strategic planning and interagency coordination, targeted programming, and bilateral and multilateral engagement. Moreover, and where practicable, CSO pursues public diplomacy as a means to sway expert and public opinion as well as develop broader awareness of its priorities, operations, and successes. These efforts are aligned with draft JSP Strategic Objectives 1.1 (Health), 1.3 (Humanitarian Leadership) and 1.4 (Peace and Security)."

U.S. government atrocity prevention efforts continue to be inhibited by decisions to prioritize other factors in bilateral relationships and give high-level attention to atrocity risks in response to crisis.

Matching internal expertise and gap analysis with emerging technologies helps CSO ensure the Department retains a technological and analytical edge that guards against malign action and shapes every aspect of our national interest abroad (Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, pp. 8)."

CSO primarily contributes in two domains: 1) providing data-driven analysis of H/NSAG networks, attributes, trends, threats, and opportunities, and 2) advocating for and advising on policy refinements that reduce barriers impeding effective engagement with and influence of H/NSAGs. This research and advocacy will include exploration of the roles that women can play in supporting H/NSAGs and in facilitating their demobilization. Combined with targeted programming, these efforts will help enable a more unified, effective Department approach to addressing the impacts of non-state actors in line with the peace and security outcomes outlined in draft JSP Strategic Objective 1.4."

At posts, stabilization advisors oversee targeted programs; support diplomatic engagements and deep-dive analyses; provide early warning for violent conflict and potential atrocities; give technical support to peace process negotiations; support the defection, de-radicalization, and reintegration of ex-combatants; and prevent the recruitment and radicalization of vulnerable populations to terrorism. At GCCs, stabilization advisors' activities integrate stabilization policies, practices, and principles, including those of the WPS, into planning documents for the command, and for identified prevention or stabilization countries. They also support the exercising or execution of these plans."
