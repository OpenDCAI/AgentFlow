Russian legislation provides for a \"special trial procedure\" for defendants who plead guilty, and \"special path\" provisions based on Russia's approach are currently being considered as part of criminal procedure reforms in Indonesia. Russia has also implemented provisions on \"pretrial cooperation agreements\" aimed at providing incentives for individuals involved in organized crime to cooperate with authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence. Georgia also provides for \"agreements on special cooperation.\" In Singapore, there are no current or proposed plea bargaining provisions in legislation. However, two programs have been implemented that enable alternative case resolution processes to be applied."

Enhancing efficiency has also been cited as a reason for the proposed \"special path\" provisions in Indonesia. In Georgia, the introduction of \"procedural agreements\" in 2004 related to attempts to address police corruption and the influence of organized criminal groups."

In Russia and Indonesia, which apply the inquisitorial model, guilty pleas may be assessed by the court as part of the totality of evidence in a trial, rather than being the determinative factor. However, Georgia, which also apples the inquisitorial model, has taken a much more liberalized approach to plea bargaining and modeled its laws on those in countries that apply an adversarial approach."

The success of the fight against organized crime strongly depended upon the readiness of delinquents to cooperate with the investigation. For that reason national criminal procedural legislation was promptly amended after Saakashvili became president, and a new procedure called the \"procedural agreement\" was introduced. Later, this procedure was supplemented with a special type of procedural agreement—the agreement on special cooperation."

The reformers faced two major challenges: notorious corruption in the police force and close ties between police and the leaders of the organized crime. A World Bank report noted that “[c]orruption was at the core of Georgia’s policing system.”<sup>1</sup> At the time that reforms were initiated, highly organized and disciplined criminal groups controlled so many aspects of the state that many believed they were more powerful than the government itself.<sup>2</sup> In order for the government to gain credibility and for the reformed police to combat organized crime, new criminal and procedural laws were introduced. These laws were modeled on the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, New Zealand law on harassment and criminal association, and British conspiracy law.<sup>3</sup> Plea bargaining was introduced to encourage apprehended mafia bosses and underlings to “roll.”<sup>4</sup>"

Some say that plea bargaining's potential is undermined by the absence of an effective witness protection system in Georgia.[17] Georgia's plea bargaining system has also been criticized for the fact that most of these deals are concluded in exchange for fines, which are sometimes irrationally high.

The \"special path\" procedure would only be available for offenses that carry a maximum sentence of imprisonment for less than seven years. It represents a shift in approach to guilty pleas in Indonesia's criminal justice system, which is based on civil law traditions, but is different from a plea bargain that is negotiated between the prosecution and defense. Several academic articles have undertaken a comparative analysis of the proposed provision, examining approaches to plea bargains in other countries, including the United States. Some commentators have raised concerns about protections for the rights of the accused, the need for standards in assessing guilty pleas, and the need for supervision of the application of the new procedures. No information was located regarding the implementation process for the new Criminal Procedure Code, should it be passed, although it is likely that some form of regulatory guidance will be issued by the government."

Rather than adopt a U.S.-style plea bargaining between the parties, the Working Group chose instead to follow the recently-reformed Russian criminal procedure code. Like the new Russian code, the Draft KUHAP's guilty plea provision is not available for the most serious crimes – it can only be used by defendants facing charges punishable by less than seven years' imprisonment. The plea will take place before a judge and the defendant enjoys certain procedural protections during the proceeding. The judge must inform the defendant of the rights he is giving up by pleading guilty and the penalties he faces. The court must also ensure that the defendant's plea is voluntary and supported by the facts. If the court is not satisfied, the judge also retains the power to reject the plea. Following the Russian model, defendants who choose to plead guilty receive a sentence of no more than two-thirds of the maximum statutory sentence.[8]"

The particular plea model the Working Group has chosen, the Russian Criminal Procedure Code, makes sense for Indonesia, a country also plagued by corruption and suspicion of the Attorney General's Office. Under the Draft KUHAP, there is no negotiated secret sentencing deal between the prosecutor and defendant facing a very lengthy jail sentence if convicted at trial. Rather, the Working Group adopted a simplified and more transparent proceeding where the judge continues to have an active truth-corroborating role and where the judge and the code, not the prosecutor, determine the maximum benefit the defendant shall receive."

However, he also states that the approaches are different, with the special path in the RUU KUHAP being better described as \"pleas without bargains\" or \"admission of guilt without negotiation.\"[11] He notes that the drafting team closes off the opportunity of agreement on sentences between the prosecutor and defendant, and that this was due to concerns about corruption. Instead, the process would take place in open court with the judge imposing the sentence on the defendant.[12] Also different from the US approach, the special path provision closes off its availability for cases involving serious crimes.[13] Having considered some ambiguities and concerns in relation to the provision as currently drafted, the author concludes that the"

Prior to this, it appears that charge bargaining occurred in an unregulated manner. Under the current provisions, a defendant must submit a request for plea bargaining to the court using the form provided in the Code. Following a brief court appearance, the prosecution and defense can proceed to agree upon a satisfactory disposition of the case. This can include plea bargaining of the charge or of the sentence. The court will then consider the agreement and dispose of the case in accordance with the relevant provision in the Code, which includes the ability to sentence the defendant to not more than half of the maximum punishment of imprisonment for the offense. Such a sentence is not available, however, where the case involves a sexually related offense, an offense that is subject to life imprisonment, an offense committed against a child under twelve years old, or where, in the case of a serious offense, the defendant has had a previous conviction for a similar offense."

Despite certain advantages of the process to the prosecutors and the offenders, the same may not be the case for the victims of crimes. The plea-bargaining process has completely taken the victims away from the criminal justice system and would seem to trample on the very interests that the criminal justice system aims to protect, which is public interest and the interests of crime victims. The impact of the plea bargaining process on female victims of crimes is even worse as the process is deemed to neglect the interests of such victims. Such a case may occur in sexual offences in which female victims would most likely be physically hurt, psychologically traumatized and emotionally abused. In reforming the said process, it is recommended that such changes should significantly support such victims to heal and seek solace as well as reconciliation. Finally, such reform should create a legal culture that revolves around restorative justice, which seeks not only to restore the gendered harm to such victims but also to give voice to these marginalized victims through the ethos of victim reparation, offender responsibility, and communities of care. The experiences in other jurisdictions such as the USA, the UK and Australia on the plea-bargaining process and victims' protection in such process might prove to be invaluable lessons for Malaysia to learn. Future research on the similar legal positions to protect victims' rights in Malaysia and those jurisdictions would be vital to shine a light on such issue.[31]"

The implementation of the practice, particularly immediately after enactment of the 2004 EFCC Act, was unpopular in Nigeria. This was largely due to the fact that it accorded the Financial Crimes Commission wide discretion to use the practice without much guidance, and this led to its use almost exclusively to deal with high-profile corruption cases in which offenders were given sentences that, at least in the perception of the public, were not commensurate with the crimes they allegedly committed. In addition, the conviction rate of cases prosecuted by the Commission remained very small and presumably not enough to help relieve courts from congestion."

To ensure adherence to its provisions, the Act makes all plea bargain agreements subject to judicial review.

According to one source, \"[t]he delay in the administration of justice and the need to decongest the prisons have informed the introduction of the concept.\"[50] However, the practice did little to accomplish this effort. Ten years after its establishment, the Commission is reported to have secured 400 convictions—forty per year.[51] It is unclear how many of these convictions were secured through plea-bargain agreements. Its record relating to high-profile offenders is even worse. In the eight years since its establishment, the EFCC has managed four high-profile convictions, three of which were obtained through a plea-bargain agreement.[52]"

Charged to court in April 2005, just months after being forced to retire as Nigeria's inspector general of police, Balogun ultimately pleaded guilty of failing to declare his assets, and his front companies were convicted of eight counts of money laundering. In December 2005 he was sentenced to six months in prison and the court ordered the seizure of his assets – reportedly worth in excess of $150 million. The sentence struck many as light given the severity of the allegations—he stood accused of financial crimes allegedly committed at a time when he was serving as Nigeria's chief law enforcement officer. Nonetheless, Balogun's conviction was a profoundly important moment—the sight of such a prominent public official being hauled before a court in handcuffs to answer for corruption was something many Nigerians had thought impossible. Balogun has since reportedly retired to a luxury home in a high-end Lagos neighborhood.[53]"

Unlike many other legal institutions, it survived the Bolshevik revolution and legally existed in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) for several decades. New criminal procedural legislation of the 1960s did not provide for a procedure similar to plea bargaining; however, unofficially it was often used in the USSR. In the post-Soviet Russia, a process called a \"special trial procedure\" was added to the new Code of Criminal Procedure several years after the Code was enacted. Though not all the members of the Russian legal community welcomed this new procedural development, it proved to be efficient and rapidly gained popularity among legal practitioners."

Article 681 of the Statute of Criminal Procedure of 1864 established a possibility of summary proceedings as an alternative to full-fledged judicial hearings. These provisions were later replicated in the first Soviet Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) of 1922 and in its later version of 1923."

The new Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR adopted in 1960 did not envisage a possibility of summary proceedings. However, despite the strong negative attitude toward the idea of a \"plot\" between public authorities and the accused, sometimes plea bargaining unofficially took place. Alexander Chashin, a Russian legal practitioner with many years of experience, points out that it was often \"initiated by investigators or prosecutors in the most complicated criminal cases when they came to understanding that at some point they can suffer total defeat from the defense attorney and his client or by defense attorneys, who realized that their client has an ace up his sleeve, and this ace can be traded to the prosecutor for something, which is not specified in the law, or by judges, who could easily understand these reasons and take them into consideration.\"[2] Chashin argues that there were unofficial cases of plea bargaining"

Although the Russian special trial procedure and plea bargaining in the United States look similar, they differ substantially.[5] Under Russian law, a defendant's express consent to the charges brought against him is a declarative statement. The special procedure does not provide for any negotiations between the parties involving the judge where some charges could be dropped.[6] If the state prosecutor or the victim (in a private prosecution where the victim has submitted a complaint directly to the court and acts as a prosecutor) agree, the defendant can give his consent to the charges and request sentencing without a trial.[7] Also, the special procedure defined in Chapter 40 of the CCP applies only to crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding a 10-year term. The judgment rendered in the special procedure cannot be appealed on the grounds of inconsistency between the findings of the court and the merits of the case. Apparently, there is similarity between the Russian special trial procedure and the US nolo contendere procedure, in which a defendant does not contest the charges and gives his consent for the proposed sentence.[8]"
