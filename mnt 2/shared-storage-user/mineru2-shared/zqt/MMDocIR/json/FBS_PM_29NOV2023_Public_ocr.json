Both Beijing and Moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to check U.S. strengths and prevent us from defending our interests and allies around the world. The PRC is modernizing its military to expand its global footprint and dominate the Indo-Pacific region, while Russia remains determined to enhance its global influence and play a disruptive role on the world stage. Regional actors like Iran and the DPRK continue to pursue new capabilities and technologies, while threatening U.S. allies and partners and challenging regional stability. Through arms transfers and security assistance, PM will help allies and partners defend themselves and the global commons against these regional threats and deter destabilizing activities."

PM's efforts to maximize the competitive advantages of the U.S. national security innovation base help ensure the U.S. military's technological superiority, deepen security cooperation with allies and partners, improve interoperability, and influence the international standards for nonproliferation and technology transfer. PM champions U.S. defense industry abroad, building long-term defense relationships with allies and partners to address shared security concerns. Furthermore, a strong domestic defense industry contributes to domestic economic renewal by expanding U.S. manufacturing and creating high-wage, high-skill jobs. PM works to safeguard America's military advantage by protecting U.S. defense technologies from exploitation, diversion, or misuse through the judicious review of arms transfers, end-use monitoring, investment screening, and engagement with the U.S. defense innovation base, to include universities. PM advances export control regulatory reforms to make U.S. export controls more comprehensible and user-friendly to both foreign partners and U.S. industry, and ensures technologies controlled on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) provide the United States with a critical military or intelligence advantage. PM actively engages with Allies and partners on export controls, including end-user and end-use obligations for defense technology and equipment. Bilateral and multilateral engagement is increasingly important since supply chains are globally interconnected – creating both benefits that unite allies and partners but also risks when supply chains grow dependent on single-points of failure or become vulnerable to exploitation."

The Bureau will continue working on advancing DEIA initiatives for its workforce in alignment with its DEIA Operational Plan and make updates to the Plan as needed. It will build a more effective, accountable, resilient, and data-literate team, equipped with the necessary tools, data, IT, and infrastructure to perform mission-critical work and meet the challenges of the next decade. PM will adapt to the changing nature of the post-pandemic environment by continuing to leverage workplace flexibilities, hybrid/remote work, and IT modernization. Through the Strategic Impact Assessment Framework (SIAF) team, the Bureau will prioritize efforts to improve knowledge management; data quality, centralization, storage, and access; and facilitate self-service retrieval of high-quality, cleared data for analysis and evaluation. PM will also establish and enforce Bureau-level data governance policies and build upon the pilot Security Cooperation Evaluation Framework (SCEF), a Bureau-wide diagnostic tool to assess the strength of partners' security sectors and PM's contributions to policy outcomes."

It established a DEIA Operational Plan (OP) to guide PM's efforts through 2026 and beyond. Guided by the DEIA OP, PM will take concrete steps to attract and retain diverse talent, guide managers, harness data, dedicate resources, and undertake meaningful reforms to establish a more diverse, equitable, accessible, and inclusive workplace and culture. PM's DEIA Council will continue its strong engagement within the Department (CDIO, S/OCR, GTM, Department Affinity Groups, and other Bureau Diversity and Inclusion Councils), and work to improve outreach to academia, HBCUs and other MSIs, Think Tanks, and NGO communities. PM will also continue to bolster its training efforts with the Foreign Service Institute and academic institutions, while also enhancing mentorship, career growth, and leadership opportunities to better develop and retain our talent. PM will continue to prioritize investments in secure space, communications, technology, and infrastructure to modernize and support much-needed upgrades to adapt to a post-COVID work environment, mitigate risk, and to help keep pace with the interagency. Additionally, PM will continue to pursue legislative flexibilities and prioritize resources for additional full-time equivalent (FTE) staff to bring more programming in-house, which will result in cost savings and increase the long-term effectiveness of diplomatic and security cooperation efforts."

The Bureau may lose people due to burnout, lack of work-life flexibilities, and frustrations over lack of DEIA representation, career mobility, and professional development opportunities. A lack of secure space will continue to hinder PM's ability to engage on urgent national security matters within the interagency and increase the risk of accidental spillage. Without much-needed IT and data modernization and infrastructure upgrades, the Bureau also risks losing talent due to an inflexible work environment and/or health concerns in a post-pandemic posture. Without legislative relief and flexibilities, as well as increased staff for in-house program management, PM may continue to lose ground in the security cooperation enterprise to DoD. For some programs, this will result in slower implementation and increased overhead costs."

Since 2018, PM's data and analytics hub, SIAF, has advanced the Bureau's modernization through the development of analytical tools and investments in data literacy and access to quality data. In 2021, the Bureau launched a pilot SCEF to holistically assess partners' security sectors and evaluate PM's contributions to foreign policy outcomes. PM is making further investments in IT and data infrastructure to expand the ability of the global political-military workforce to better leverage analytics resources and products and strengthen data literacy, culture, and collaboration."

It will take years of data collection to identify meaningful trends in the performance of U.S. security partners and to identify PM contributions to partner outcomes. The metrics for a handful of SCEF sub-outcomes remain undefined or in need of improvement. Transitioning to a data-literate culture will involve an initial learning curve for the entire Bureau as personnel work to acquire and practice new data skills. PM offices and personnel will need to commit time to develop those skillsets, potentially at the cost of other learning opportunities."
