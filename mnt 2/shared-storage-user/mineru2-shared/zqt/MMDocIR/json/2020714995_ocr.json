The EU in non-binding guidance to Member States recommended the use of voluntary apps because of the \"high degree of intrusiveness\" of mandatory apps. However, some exceptions were observed. In the UK, a body established to consider the ethics of the app noted that it would be possible to require the app for individuals returning to work or using public transportation. In Argentina, installing the contact tracing app is generally voluntary; however, people who enter the country from abroad and people who return to work are obligated to install it. India's contact tracing app's use was considered voluntary when launched in early April but became mandatory for public- and private-sector employees in early May. This requirement was eased in late May after criticism from privacy and digital rights organizations. In China, even though the health code apps that assign different color codes to people depending on their infection status appear not to have been made compulsory, they are de facto compulsory in many cities as citizens without the code are not able to enter most public places. In Turkey, travelers whose HES codes on their app indicate that they were diagnosed as positive or have been in contact with a person diagnosed as such are not allowed to use public transportation or airplanes. In Russia, all people identified as having been in contact with an infected individual must install the \"Social Monitoring app\" or face a fine. Individuals with no cell phone receive special devices with a preinstalled Social Monitoring app. And, as noted below, in some countries persons required to quarantine must install an app to allow the authorities to monitor their movement."

South Africa established an interim database in which health care professionals who test a person for COVID-19 must enter the person's identification and contact information, including cellphone number, for inclusion in the database. The French government has developed two electronic databases, one where all COVID-19 test results are recorded and one to facilitate contact tracing. The data in both systems may only be accessed by medical professionals who are subject to medical confidentiality. In China, the health code apps reportedly rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user, COVID-19 databases set up by government authorities, and data held by other sources, including the public transportation, telecommunications, and banking sectors."

South Korea has developed an electronic wristband that monitors people's compliance with self-quarantine; however, it is not mandatory and violators must consent to wearing it. Spain used mobile phone location data to track people's movements and verify how closely the nationwide lockdown was being observed. Norway used telecommunication data to determine whether people complied with travel restrictions during the month of March 2020; however, no individuals were targeted by that approach. In Russia, QR codes that serve as digital passes were required to use public transportation for the self-isolated population. Taiwan's \"digital fence\" monitors the location of those required to undergo home quarantine via their own cellphones or government-issued cellphones, with the goal of preventing their movement. In the United Arab Emirates, people who are ordered to quarantine must install an app, which sends alerts to them to stay within the range of movement allowed during the quarantine and provides health authorities with the precise location of these individuals."

Israel has utilized the surveillance technologies of the Israel Security Agency (ISA) to trace patients and those with whom they came into contact during the period from mid-March 2020 to early June 2020. In response to a ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court requiring the ISA activities to be defined in legislation and public criticism over privacy concerns, the government announced on June 8, 2020, that it would no longer utilize ISA surveillance for tracing COVID-19 patients or promote relevant legislation in this regard unless a new outbreak takes place."

South Korea, for example, has been criticized for releasing a detailed log of movements of COVID-19 patients, including the time and names of places they visited, through the media and related websites. The European Data Protection Board has voiced concerns with regard to apps that use location tracking as they violate the principle of data minimization. In Australia, critics voiced concerns that United States law enforcement entities could gain access to the app data, because the data is being hosted in Australia by Amazon Web Services, a US company subject to the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act). Iceland's app, on the other hand, has received international recognition as one of the least invasive apps from a privacy perspective."

The app uses Bluetooth signals to record a user's contacts with other users and saves the encrypted information on their phone; it does not record location information. The contact data of a user who tests positive for COVID-19 can be uploaded to a central storage system and accessed by state and territory authorities as part of their contact tracing processes. The app is voluntary to download and users must grant permission for their data to be uploaded. The most recent figures available show that around \\(23\\%\\) of Australians have downloaded the app."

The bill inserted a new part into the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) that, for example, defines the data that is collected by the app; contains rules and offenses regarding access to and use of that data; provides for oversight, complaint processes, and reporting requirements related to the app; and sets out a process for determining the end of the data period, at which point data stored in the central system will be deleted."

It recommends voluntary apps that comply with data protection and privacy rules and are deleted once they are no longer necessary. Its recommendation sets out detailed rules for the development of such apps and for the use of anonymized mobility data. The eHealth Network, a voluntary network that provides a platform of Member States' competent authorities dealing with digital health, has published a practical guide for Member States for developing privacy-preserving mobile apps for contact tracing. It is planning on publishing another toolbox for the use of mobility data in June 2020."

The data protection legal framework in the EU currently consists of two main pillars, the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy Directive) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive set out various requirements for the processing of traffic and location data. In general, consent is required or processing must be necessary for the provision of the service; however, exceptions are possible for reasons of public interest such as public health, or for public security. Derogations must be necessary, appropriate, and proportionate measures. In addition, the EU Decision on Combating Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health, which lays down rules on epidemiological surveillance and on monitoring, early warning, and responsive measures to combat serious cross-border threats to health, allows the transmission of personal data necessary for the purpose of contact tracing."

Instead, national data retention laws are applicable, but they are subject to review by the CJEU.[42] The CJEU stated that data retention obligations and access to that data are only permissible under EU law if they are strictly necessary.[43] In the Court's opinion, EU law precludes national legislation that prescribes general and indiscriminate retention of data.[44] The Commission announced in 2017 that it would develop guidance as to how national data retention laws can be constructed to comply with the CJEU ruling; however, such guidance has not yet been released.[45]"

The Commission recommends the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communications data or data generated by equivalent technology for this purpose.[90] In the opinion of the Commission, BLE, unlike geolocation data, is more precise, thereby minimizing the risk of having false positives, and avoids the possibility of tracking.[91] It should only be recorded when there is an actual risk of infection.[92] The Commission advises against the use of location data as it is not necessary for contact tracing."

When a user has tested positive and inputs that information into the app, where it is subsequently stored, an automatic alert is sent to the close contacts (decentralized processing). The Commission recommends that the alert message should be drafted by the health authorities. Under the second option, arbitrary temporary identifiers that cannot directly identify the user are stored on a backend server held by the health authorities. Users who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive receive an alert on their phone through the identifiers (centralized processing). For contact via phone or text message, health authorities would need additional consent of those users.[93] The Commission prefers the first solution as it aligns better with the principle of data minimization.[94] There is no need to reveal the identity of the infected person to the individuals who have been in close contact with him or her.[95]"

When proximity data is collected via BLE, the Commission recommends establishing and storing temporary device IDs that change regularly instead of the actual ID.[100] Temporary IDs offer more protection against hacking and tracking. Additional security measures proposed are automatic deletion or anonymization of data after a certain time. In general, the more sensitive the data is, the more security is required. The EDPB additionally recommends that a mechanism be established to verify the status of users who log a positive test result in the app—for example, by providing a single-use code linked to a test station or health care professional.[101]"

The Commission advises Member States to exchange best practices on the use of mobility data, share and compare modelling and predictions of the spread of the virus, and monitor the impact of measures to limit its spread.[112] It emphasizes that the appropriate use of anonymized and aggregated mobility data for modelling needs to be addressed and the methodology that providers used for anonymizing"

The use and sharing of data is regulated by the Data Protection Act, which implements the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. England is developing an app that will operate via Bluetooth and use a centralized system to alert individuals who have been in close proximity to a user who later reports symptoms of COVID-19. England has also developed a Test and Trace Program, which involves a significant number of people to track and trace the contacts of people who report symptoms of COVID-19 either online, through the app, or via the telephone. There is no new legislation to introduce the app, the use of which is entirely voluntary. While the government has faced criticism for not introducing legislation to underpin the app, it claims that new legislation is not necessary as the use of the app is entirely voluntary and that data is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Human Rights Act 1998."

The \"Contact COVID\" database collects information on positive cases, such as where they live and work, and who they are in regular contact with, to facilitate contact tracing. Additionally, the French government is deploying a smartphone app, called StopCovid, to help with contact tracing. This app, which is used on a purely voluntary basis, relies on Bluetooth technology to notify its user if he or she has been in close proximity to a person infected by COVID-19 for 15 minutes or more. This app is controversial and has elicited concerns over whether it is lawful under French and European privacy laws. The CNIL has issued two opinions declaring it to be legal, so long as certain conditions are respected. The French Parliament approved the app's deployment in a nonbinding vote on May 27, 2020."

However, the right to apply specific measures aimed at enforcement of policies to combat the pandemic, including the employment of new technologies to monitor the community spread of COVID-19 and trace the contacts of infected people, has been given to the governors of the constituent components of the Russian Federation. Some regions have amended their provincial laws in order to ensure the legality of newly implemented policies. Most of the time, the use of technology has extended to tracing contacts, monitoring one's location, and fining people for disobeying the isolation orders. Several regions have required the registration of the total population in order to obtain electronic Quick Response codes that serve as digital passes allowing individuals to leave their primary residences. Legal observers have noticed that these measures are not in line with Russian privacy and data protection legislation. As a follow-up to the pandemic, the Government introduced new federal legislation aimed at defining the legal regime for the forced quarantining of the population and building a nationwide population database."

The new law protects the right of law enforcement to receive this information from mobile communications providers when a search for a missing child is conducted. Law enforcement authorities are required to receive judicial approval within 48 hours for the usage of geolocation information.[18] Later, the legislature discussed a proposal to expand the right of police to use geolocation information in all search and rescue operations and allow the mobile phone users to transfer this information to third persons, however, this bill did not advance beyond the first reading.[19] In 2016, a court found that when a telecom company shares with third persons information about its customers, including their geolocation information, it commits a violation of the licensing agreement.[20]"

The city government stated that disclosure of this information does not constitute a violation of data protection rules. While lawyers disagree with this government position, they believe that individuals have no chance for remediation and compensation.[30] Formally, government institutions can receive personal information from private companies under the court order only. Law enforcement may be allowed to have access to this information during investigative operations based on a special request. It appears that such information is shared most of the time regardless of the legal arrangements. Authorities also have information to all the personal data of individuals who have been registered on the web portal for state services because such a registration requires the customer's consent for transfer of information to the third persons. Russian experts say that even when information includes nonpersonal data, there are possibilities for full identification of a person.[31]"

Reasons for pass requests are, for example, visiting relatives, traveling to summer homes in the country, meeting with an attorney or a notary, and accompanying minors, among other things. Each pass is valid for two 60-minute trips.[32] In another region, the local administration partnered with a regional bank in which the regional government is a major stakeholder and asked all residents applying for the digital passes to consent to the processing of their personal information by the bank.[33]"

About 54,000 fines were issued to about one-third of those who were under surveillance. Some people were fined several times. People complain that they are fined for not sending a selfie on time or when the GPS erroneously shows that a person has left his or her residence. About 400 people were fined for not responding to self-identification requests received at nighttime. Later, the nighttime self-identification requests were terminated and fines were canceled. The city government allows a person to dispute a fine but the procedure is reportedly long and complicated. Each person who allegedly violates the house quarantine rules is fined in the amount of RUB4,000 (approximately US$70) under the city law.[35] While federal legislation provides for 10 times higher fines for approximately the same violations, it is the regional laws, which were quickly amended with detailed norms regulating the behavior of different categories of the population during the pandemic,[36] that are enforced.[37]"

Presently, Russian law differentiates between an emergency situation and a state of emergency. The Law on Emergency Situations emphasizes that additional measures undertaken by government authorities to mitigate the consequences of the emergency cannot restrict the rights and freedoms of people. These rights, specifically the right to free movement, were limited by isolation rules recently imposed by regional governments to fight the pandemic. These regional measures appeared to be in contradiction with federal legislation. The amendment appears to be able to bring the practice in line with legislation and create legal grounds for restriction of rights in the future.[38]"

Legislators who introduced the Law stated that no medical or biometric information will be collected, although a person's social security and health insurance information shall be included in the database. The Law allows individuals to request information from the database and provides for the creation of a secure part of the database for information on persons placed under state protection. The Law will enter into force as soon as it is published, and a transition period will be established through December 31, 2026. The Law makes it possible for the collected information to be shared among government agencies and institutions.[39] Legislators from the opposition parties said that the Law contradicts the Constitution and violates the privacy rights of citizens. They stated that, presently, there are no technical means in Russia to guarantee the safety of the collected information.[40]"

Under the state of alarm, the government is empowered to take all measures necessary to protect the health and safety of citizens and strengthen the public health system, in addition to preventing and containing the virus and mitigating the health, social, and economic impacts. The Ley General de Sanidad also empowers health authorities, in epidemic situations, to establish extreme measures to protect public and individual health. Among these measures, the National Institute of Statistics has developed an app called \"DataCovid,\" which is based on data provided by the main telecommunications operators. It uses positioning data from mobile devices, anonymized and aggregated, guaranteeing strict compliance with data protection standards."

The Turkish Ministry of Health employs electronic systems implemented via mobile applications to inform the populace of the risks, track the spread of the virus, and implement isolation measures. To date, the Ministry of Health has launched two mobile applications; one primarily for warning users when they approach areas with a high risk of infection and preventing high-risk individuals from using public vehicles for intercity travel, and the other for assigning positive cases and their possible contacts to members of contact tracing teams. Personal health data collected by these applications appear to be processed under a special rule allowing sensitive health data to be processed without the explicit consent of data subjects for purposes of the protection of public health."

The main national legal framework that provides the general rules and principles of personal data protection in Turkish law is set forth in the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LPPD) and the various relevant secondary legislation that governs certain aspects of personal data protection law such as the processing of personal health data, the protection of personal data in electronic communications, and the erasure, destruction, or anonymization of personal data.[7] These are complemented by personal data protection statutes in numerous laws that regulate the provision of services in the public and private sectors. The protection of privacy and personal data in the electronic communications sector is governed by the Regulation on the Processing and Protection of the Privacy of Personal Data in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECommDPR).[8]"

This information is then used for assigning a risk factor to the user and populating an epidemic heat map that can be viewed by application users, if the user shares his or her location data with the application. Users may also track the risk status and location of their consenting family members by adding them to their profile. The application warns the user if he or she, or a family member who was added to the profile, enters a high-risk zone.

Among the constitutional authorities granted to the Supreme National Security Council is the power to entrust parts of its responsibilities to sub-councils, in which case those sub-councils remain under the control of the President of the country, or the President can delegate the control to another member of the Supreme National Security Council.

To illustrate, when a person is located at a supermarket and comes close to another person whose phone also has TraceCovid installed, the application on both mobile devices exchanges an encrypted STI and stores the exchanged STI locally on their devices. The STI consists of anonymized data and a timestamp. In the event that one of those two people gets the virus, the health department will request that the infected person upload the list of STIs stored locally on that person's mobile phone. Such information will assist the medical authorities in contacting other people who may have come in close contact with the infected person and identify them faster to minimize the spread of the virus.[23]"
