PRM's humanitarian assistance is provided on the basis of need according to principles of universality, impartiality, and human dignity. Protection strategies are integrated across multiple sectors including water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, food, health and nutrition, education, livelihoods activities, and camp management. PRM-supported assistance programs are designed to identify and protect the most vulnerable within affected populations, such as single heads of households, children, including unaccompanied and separated children, adolescent girls and young women, pregnant women, older persons, persons with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ individuals to ensure that they have equal access to life-sustaining goods and services. This goal supports the Joint Strategic Plan Strategic Objective 1.3: Reinvigorate U.S. humanitarian leadership and provide lifesaving protection and assistance in response to international disasters and humanitarian crises overseas. It also supports the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality as it aims to address the needs of people in vulnerable situations, including women and girls, LGBTQI+ people, and people with disabilities."

Children may be separated from their families or persons with disabilities or older persons may be unable to access emergency services. Populations like LGBTQ+ or stateless persons may be vulnerable to exploitation, and women and girls become particularly vulnerable to GBV. PRM humanitarian assistance programs help prevent and respond to protection concerns through a range of activities, from prevention and awareness raising to services, including medical, legal, livelihood, and psychosocial services, as well as capacity-development and training programs for humanitarian personnel and service providers. Of note, in FY 2013, PRM and USAID launched Safe from the Start to respond to ongoing needs of women and girls at the onset of emergencies and to elevate prevention of GBV as a life-saving priority; in FY 2022, PRM and USAID will re-launch this initiative based on evaluation findings and lessons learned. In addition to providing targeted assistance, the Bureau also provides integrated or \"mainstreamed\" programs that address GBV within multi-sectoral assistance programs and closely monitors the extent to which its programming includes activities to address GBV as well as assist GBV survivors and those most at risk of GBV. The Bureau also supports protection response through policies and programming such as dedicated financial support to address statelessness and an increased focus on the needs of LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum seekers. Finally, the Bureau seeks to advance the protection of children, as the largest vulnerable population of displaced persons, through increased funding and new partnerships. This objective supports JSP Objective 1.3 as it supports the provision of life-saving protection and assistance specifically for people in vulnerable situations and leverages U.S. leadership in the multilateral and bilateral arenas for humanitarian goals. It also supports the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality as it aims to"

Many children spend their entire childhood in displacement settings. These refugees often live in overcrowded camps or settlements, and in some cases, they lack freedom of movement, do not have access to land, and are prohibited from legal employment or access to quality education. Alongside third country resettlement and absent opportunity for sustainable return in safety and dignity, local inclusion and self-reliance offer an important interim solution for affected people. When a host country offers local integration through an immigration status that ends the person's status as refugee, these same approaches support a highly valued durable solution.

PRM's protection advocacy efforts seek to: prevent the forcible return of refugees to a place where their lives or freedom would be threatened (refoulement); negotiate access for humanitarian agencies to operate safely and reach civilians affected by conflict; promote the resolution of protracted refugee situations; prevent and reduce statelessness; and promote adherence to international humanitarian and human rights law. PRM provides contributions to and leads American engagement with UNHCR, ICRC, IOM, UNRWA, and UNFPA. PRM support to UNHCR and the ICRC is critical to USG international protection efforts, given their international protection mandates. Resources to support policy development, effective management, and diplomacy at UNHCR and ICRC headquarters are devoted to this goal. This goal also supports the interim National Security Strategy, which states, \"At its root, ensuring our national security requires us to lead and sustain a stable and open international system, underwritten by strong democratic alliances, partnerships, multilateral institutions, and rules.\" It also supports Joint Strategic Plan Strategic Objectives 1.3: Reinvigorate U.S. humanitarian leadership and provide lifesaving protection and assistance in response to"

The Bureau also will support learning and career advancement for PRM employees through appropriate staffing, training opportunities, and mentoring/leadership activities. PRM stresses accountability and transparency and uses administrative resources to enable its staff to travel overseas to monitor programs in the field and has expanded its remote monitoring functions in the COVID-19 environment. PRM's overseas regional Refugee Coordinator positions play a crucial role in the Bureau's program performance monitoring, humanitarian policy development and advocacy, and emergency response. PRM will exercise due diligence by monitoring funded organizations to ensure that U.S. foreign assistance reaches its intended beneficiaries.

Strengthening PRM's evidence-based program efforts is a priority for the Bureau and is also reflected in the Department's Learning Agenda. Investments of time and financial resources in evaluation, research, and training enable the Bureau and its partners to better design and manage humanitarian assistance programs thereby enhancing impact and performance and ensuring sound stewardship of USG resources on behalf of beneficiaries and American taxpayers. External, independent evaluation is a key analytical tool that enables staff to learn from past experience and to employ good practices in future programming. PRM strives to ensure sufficient resources for program evaluations, including for the evaluative activities of its partners. These resources enable PRM staff to evaluate the impact of PRM programs and manage them more effectively, enhancing the high level of performance across all PRM programs. This objective supports JSP Objective 4.1 as it aims to equip PRM staff with the tools they need to effectively carry out their work."
