The law sets forth principles, according to which both public governmental agencies and the private sector are to conduct scientific research. Several government agencies and commissions are established at the national level. The provinces also have their own scientific research institutions. Another national law of 1996 mandates the creation of hospital ethics committees at every public hospital. Another national law of 2013 creates the National Registry of Genetic Data for criminal purposes, but also addresses general principles concerning the gathering and use of genetic information. In addition, a decree promulgated in 1997 prohibits cloning experiments related to humans. Moreover, a national law of 2000 established a registry of hematopoietic progenitor cell donors, and its provisions are adopted and further developed at the provincial level, examples of which are cited in this report."

The article affirms that the benefits derived from the use of stem cells are undeniable, but their ethical use is still an issue because the beginning of life has yet to be determined. Moreover, the indiscriminate use of such a technique could lead to a dehumanization of life, making it relatively normal to shorten life. According to the authors, these issues justified the need for the promulgation of the Biosafety Law.[65]"

Holders of authorizations for provisional use for research purposes are liable for damages caused during the research. Law No. 20,584 of 2012, protecting the rights and duties of persons in actions related to their health care, provides that all persons have the right to grant or deny their consent to undergo any procedure or treatment related to their health care. This law strengthened the requirement of prior, informed, and written consent from patients in the case of clinical trials or any type of biomedical scientific research. The situation of impaired persons is also specially regulated so that consent may be provided by themselves or their legal representatives in the most appropriate manner. The law also allows for the establishment of Scientific Ethics Committees throughout the country to oversee and authorize scientific research on persons. In particular, Law No. 20,120 of 2006, on Scientific Research on Human Beings, Their Genomes, and Prohibiting Human Cloning contains stringent prohibitions regarding biomedical scientific research on human beings that involves some type of physical or psychological intervention, and it sets forth detailed procedures for the approval of protocols and the granting of consent by test subjects. Lastly, the Bill to Promote the Scientific Research in Cell Therapy and Stem Cells is currently pending in the Chilean Congress. The bill would amend existing legislation to establish a legal framework for the promotion of scientific research in cell therapy and stem cells."

In a 2011 decision by the Supreme Court, the Court acknowledged that the petitioners had experienced no adverse effects during the treatment with stem cells, thus invalidating any legal basis for the Ministry of Health to halt ongoing treatments, allowing the plaintiffs to continue their therapy. However, this decision had limitations as it did not overturn the ban entirely. Instead, it only granted authorization to those who were currently undergoing stem cell treatment."
