India's trade deficit widened further to touch USD 56.7 billion, an increase of \\(40.6\\%\\) over 2005/06, mainly on account of a sharp increase in the value of oil imports. However, net invisibles surplus on account of buoyant service exports helped ameliorate the impact on the current account. The overall position on external balances remains strong with foreign exchange reserves increasing by USD 47 billion during the year. The strong overall economic performance during the year was however accompanied by rising inflation. Several policy measures were announced in response, aimed at curtailing liquidity and improving supply side conditions. These included the increase in the repo rate and cash reserve ratio, duty free imports of wheat and pulses, and reduction in import duties on non-ferrous metals, cement, capital goods etc."

However, economic growth does not necessarily translate to sustainable development. The manner of industrial growth so far has taken an immeasurable toll of finite natural resources, and yet left vast numbers of people in poverty. On the one hand, depletion of biodiversity resources – soil, water, air – has considerably increased the fragility of ecological balance. On the other hand, the declining rate of growth of agriculture has led to the present situation where nearly \\(60\\%\\) of India's population shares less than \\(20\\%\\) of its output.

Cigarettes continue to be discriminated against cheaper and revenue inefficient tobacco products like bidis and chewing tobaccos. Excise duty rates on cigarettes were increased for the second successive year. However, while duty rates on cigarettes went up in excess of \\(6\\%\\) in the Union Budget 2007, the same were left unchanged in respect of most of the other tobacco products. Moreover, with effect from 1st April, 2007, cigarettes have been brought under the ambit of Value Added Tax (VAT) by the States at a rate of \\(12.5\\%\\) on invoice price, without a reduction/set off in excise duties collected in lieu of State level sales tax. Such a move is against the opinion of Expert Committees on taxation which have, for more than a decade, repeatedly and consistently recommended the exclusion of cigarettes from ad-valorem duties in favour of a single-point specific excise duty structure."

An ad-valorem levy such as VAT on a highly taxed product like cigarettes can have grievous consequences on the livelihood of more than a million farmers and farm-workers.

Since the bulk of tobacco products, apart from cigarettes, are manufactured in the unorganised sector, the provisions of COTPA will, in effect, apply mainly to domestic cigarette manufacture. While smuggled stocks will, in any case, not bear such warnings, most other tobacco products could also escape these stringent legislative requirements. This will give a further fillip to the contraband market in India. While these provisions of COTPA were notified to be effective from 1st June, 2007, in response to representations from stakeholders in the industry, implementation has now been deferred to enable a Committee of Ministers to examine the issues arising from these provisions and make suitable recommendations to the Government. It is hoped that the Committee will take on board the views of all segments of the tobacco industry before framing its recommendations to ensure a fair and equitable legislative climate for all tobacco products."
