Our word recognition models build upon the RNN semicharacter architecture, introducing several new backoff strategies for handling rare and unseen words. Trained to recognize words corrupted by random adds, drops, swaps, and keyboard mistakes, our method achieves \\(32\\%\\) relative (and \\(3.3\\%\\) absolute) error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model. Notably, our pipeline confers robustness on the downstream classifier, outperforming both adversarial training and off-the-shelf spell checkers. Against a BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, a single adversarially-chosen character attack lowers accuracy from \\(90.3\\%\\) to \\(45.8\\%\\). Our defense restores accuracy to \\(75\\%^{1}\\). Surprisingly, better word recognition does not always entail greater robustness. Our analysis reveals that robustness also depends upon a quantity that we denote the sensitivity."

Consequently, adversarial edits can degrade a word-level model by transforming the informative words to UNK. Intuitively, one might suspect that word-piece and character-level models would be less susceptible to spelling attacks as they can make use of the residual word context. However, our experiments demonstrate that character and word-piece models are in fact more vulnerable. We show that this is due to the adversary's effective capacity for finer grained manipulations on these models. While against a word-level model, the adversary is mostly limited to UNK-ing words, against a word-piece or character-level model, each character-level add, drop, or swap produces a distinct input, providing the adversary with a greater set of options."

While our word recognizers are trained on domain-specific text from the task at hand, they often predict UNK at test time, owing to the small domain-specific vocabulary. To handle unobserved and rare words, we propose several backoff strategies including falling back on a generic word recognizer trained on a larger corpus. Incorporating our defenses, BERT models subject to 1-character attacks are restored to 88.3, 81.1, 78.0 accuracy for swap, drop, add attacks respectively, as compared to 69.2, 63.6, and 50.0 for adversarial training"

Jia and Liang (2017) address the reading comprehension task, showing that by appending distractor sentences to the end of stories from the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), they could cause models to output incorrect answers. Inspired by this work, Glockner et al. (2018) demonstrate an attack that breaks entailment systems by replacing a single word with either a synonym or its hybernym. Recently, Zhao et al. (2018) investigated the problem of producing natural-seeming adversarial examples, noting that adversarial examples in NLP are often ungrammatical (Li et al., 2016)."

While their focus is on efficient methods for generating adversaries, ours is on improving the worst case adversarial performance. Similarly, Belinkov and Bisk (2018) studied how synthetic and natural noise affects character-level machine translation. They considered structure invariant representations and adversarial training as defenses against such noise. Here, we show that an auxiliary word recognition model, which can be trained on unlabeled data, provides a strong defense."

Let \\( s = \\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\} \\) denote the input sentence, a sequence of constituent words \\( w_i \\). Each input word \\( (w_i) \\) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hot vector of the first character \\( (\\mathbf{w}_{i1}) \\); (ii) a one hot representation of the last character \\( (\\mathbf{w}_{il} \\), where \\( l \\) is the length of word \\( w_i \\)); and (iii) a bag of characters representation of the internal characters \\( (\\sum_{j=2}^{l-1} \\mathbf{w}_{ij}) \\). ScRNN treats the first and the last characters individually, and is agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. Each word, represented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTM cell. At each sequence step, the training target is the correct corresponding word (output dimension equal to vocabulary size), and the model is optimized with cross-entropy loss."

We consider three input formats for this architecture: (1) Word-only: where the input words are encoded using a lookup table; (2) Char-only: where the input words are encoded using a separate single-layered BiLSTM over their characters; and (3) Word+Char: where the input words are encoded using a concatenation of (1) and (2) 6."

This provides more variations that an attacker can exploit. Following similar reasoning, add and key attacks pose a greater threat than swap and drop attacks. The robustness of different models can be ordered as word-only \\(>\\) word+char \\(>\\) char-only \\(\\sim\\) word-piece, and the efficacy of different attacks as add \\(>\\) key \\(>\\) drop \\(>\\) swap."
