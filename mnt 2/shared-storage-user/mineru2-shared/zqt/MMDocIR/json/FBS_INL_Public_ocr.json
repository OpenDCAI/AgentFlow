The global challenges faced by the international community today – climate change, pandemic disease, growing inequality, social fragmentation – present opportunities for criminal profit, exacerbating the challenges and inhibiting effective responses. The adoption of technological innovations by transnational criminals not only often outpaces the abilities of governments to respond, but emerging cyber tools enable criminal organizations to narrow the gap between state and non-state capabilities. In some cases, the capability of non-state criminal actors exceeds the ability of a state to respond to or prevent those crimes. The ability of our foreign partners to mitigate crime and corruption is essential to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and development priorities."

Overseas, strategic competitors leverage criminal activity, criminal proxies, and transnational corruption to advance political goals. Fragile states are particularly vulnerable to transnational crime and corruption, as illicit economies enable conflict, undermine government credibility, and inhibit economic development. At the community level, organized crime and inadequate criminal justice systems undermine rule of law and disproportionately affect marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented communities.

These complex challenges require INL to be more closely coordinated with other bureaus across the Department and USAID, so our activities are as mutually reinforcing as possible. INL's work is further predicated on close partnerships within the U.S. interagency, especially law enforcement agencies, and a range of other actors, including civil society, public health practitioners, U.S. state and local criminal justice practitioners, international organizations, private sector actors, academia, and our international partners. INL collaborates with criminal justice agencies to ensure foreign assistance and diplomatic engagement properly align to meet emerging threats. Through enduring commitment to advancing the rule of law and responsive, inclusive, and accountable criminal justice systems, INL activities are essential to demonstrating that democracy delivers. This role requires that INL is clear in its strategic priorities, agile enough to adapt to changing circumstances, and ensures a cycle of learning to measure progress, more smartly integrate"

This goal focuses on illicit markets out of a recognition of both supply and demand aspects, as well as the proceeds of criminal activity. Proceeds from illicit markets fund other forms of transnational crime and provide financial wherewithal to challenge legitimate state institutions. Illicit markets exist for commodities (drugs, resources, wildlife, weapons), to exploit people, and for data and intellectual property. State actors facilitate criminal activity around the globe, and states such as Russia and the PRC leverage criminal proxies to achieve policy objectives, blurring the line between state and non-state threats. Technological advances from encrypted communications to virtual currency and e-commerce facilitate criminal activity, and governments struggle to keep up with the pace of innovation. The United States relies on capable foreign partners to cooperate to address these transnational threats to security, governance, and economic development. INL is the Department's lead for international drug control and transnational organized crime issues. Preserving the viability of UN drug control and anti-crime conventions as international standards and effective mechanisms for cooperation across borders is central to INL's approach. INL builds partner capacity, fosters international cooperation, maintains platforms to exchange information and best practices, and manages a variety of U.S. deterrence and enforcement mechanisms."

According to the FBI, reported losses to U.S. victims from cybercrime in 2020 alone exceeded $4.2 billion. The transnational nature of cybercrime makes not only the international architecture for cooperation essential to enforcement, but also requires maintenance of relevant institutions to keep these mechanisms current in the face of technological and criminal innovations. International cooperation is significantly challenged by uneven implementation of existing legal frameworks, such as the U.S.-supported Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Building partner capacity to bring criminals to justice is an essential complement to broader U.S. government efforts that prioritize prevention through cybersecurity. This objective aligns to JSP objective 1.4 (Peace and Security), the Department's technology policy pillars, and the National Cyber Strategy."

It is increasingly weaponized by authoritarian states to undermine democracy. Corruption increases the risk that U.S. foreign assistance will be misappropriated, and U.S. attempts to address it may run the risk of inadvertently reinforcing corrupt power structures. As part of its longstanding leadership on this issue, the United States has ensured that the rules-based international system incorporates principles of transparency, integrity, and accountable governance and has promoted the institutionalization of recognized international standards through the adoption of legally binding treaties, political commitments, and best practices. INL's approach to combating corruption balances prevention and enforcement, recognizes the contribution of good governance, and empowers both internal (e.g., inspectors general) and external (e.g., legislative, journalistic, citizen) oversight. Likewise, money laundering undermines the integrity of the worldwide financial system and facilitates and conceals crime: all forms of transnational organized crime share the common objectives of hiding and legitimizing criminal proceeds, some of which are drawn upon in turn to finance further operations. Financial facilitators obscure the proceeds of crime and corruption and returning stolen assets and addressing regulatory vulnerabilities across jurisdictions are essential given the rapid movement of financial assets across borders."

Combating corruption is a whole of society effort, involving civil society, the media, and the private sector to prevent, detect, and expose corruption, and ensure effective enforcement and accountability. INL's activities are grounded in the major elements of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the only legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument. Corruption within criminal justice institutions stymies a key mechanism for accountability. As a result, deterrence and disruption of corruption through the effective operation of the criminal justice system and delivery of sentences, confiscations, and other enforcement outcomes are indispensable pieces of the response. This objective includes INL's efforts to criminalize and deliver justice for corruption, including technical assistance related to substantive laws and criminal procedures codes, sufficiency of institutions, skill-building, and ensuring countries effectively leverage existing mechanisms for international cooperation. This objective aligns to JSP objective 3.3 (Combating Corruption), which INL leads for the Department, as well as the U.S. Strategy to Counter Corruption."

These processes are referred to as illicit finance, of which money laundering is a subset. Money laundering facilitates and conceals crime and undermines the worldwide financial system and involves a range of methodologies from misuse of digital assets, trade-based money laundering, bulk-cash smuggling, and use of fintech or other emerging technology. Effective anti-money laundering regimes adopt Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and necessarily include adequate legal frameworks, effective institutions, and adequate human capital. This objective includes INL's efforts to strengthen AML regimes through adoption of FATF standards on both technical compliance and effective implementation, including requisite technological capabilities and understanding of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks of money laundering. INL's publication of the annual Vol. II (money laundering) of the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, its integration of AML into other program areas, and the bureau's work to strengthen AML measures in anticrime fora complement programmatic efforts. This objective aligns to JSP objectives 3.3 (Combating Corruption) and 2.1 (Economic Governance), the U.S. Strategy to Counter Corruption, and the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing."

This goal advances a rule of law-based approach as essential to the U.S. priority of demonstrating that democracy can deliver for people around the world. Civilian security institutions and criminal justice systems have an important role in the continuum of international security cooperation, which relies on common international standards and norms, achieved through multilateral engagement. Grievances related to actual or perceived inequity in the criminal justice system contribute to instability and social fragmentation that authoritarian and other actors can exploit. Effective, resilient, and responsive criminal justice systems are rooted in rule of law and respect for human rights and enhance trust between the government and the population by being inclusive and responsive to the needs of all members of a community. INL's work toward this goal contributes to ensuring criminal justice systems provide a space for all people's rights to be protected and their voices heard."

This puts civilian security institutions on the front lines, particularly for issues related to territorial integrity, freedom of navigation as other non-military forces are used to assert and maintain sovereignty and administrative control of disputed areas. Civilian security institutions are also often involved in the effective management of land borders. Ensuring our partner nations have the capacity to secure their own borders from irregular migration can lessen the number of irregular migrants ultimately reaching or attempting to return to the United States. Furthermore, while effective border management is an important aspect of addressing the smuggling of drugs, goods, and people, and deterring irregular migration, civilian security institutions involved in maintaining land and maritime borders contribute to a stable international security environment by deterring territorial incursions or the unlawful exploitation of natural resources that have the potential to escalate into regional conflict. This objective includes INL's efforts to build institutional capacity related to certain specialized law enforcement functions, border management, maritime law enforcement, and efforts related to peacekeeping.

INL programs in fragile states should foster legitimate, inclusive, transparent, and accountable criminal justice systems that equitably serve their communities and instill trust in public institutions and governance. Furthermore, INL activities reduce the criminal markets that enable conflict and instability. This objective includes INL's programming efforts in countries identified as priorities for stabilization or conflict prevention, as well as efforts related to atrocity prevention.

INL continues to make progress in being an agile, strategy-led organization, including through active management of human capital, developing integrated information management systems, and optimizing resources to achieve the bureau's outcomes. INL is also committed to becoming a learning organization, which has three primary lines of effort: developing uniform program management guidance; implementing a consolidated, adult-centric approach to internal and external training; and being a source of thought leadership and technical expertise in drug control and criminal justice reform. The end results are more rigorous assessments pointing INL toward smarter programming; project designs that lay out clear and feasible goals; external training that is consistently conducted to the highest standard; and effective monitoring and evaluations of results inform future programming. INL advances its commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility both externally in INL programs and policy engagements and internally, through both established institutional mechanisms and through an employee-led Diversity and Inclusion Council (D&IC)."

The plan resulted in a significant number of direct hire personnel being reassigned duties and responsibilities as well as a reprogramming of a handful of vacant positions to allow for career advancement. The realignment clarified roles and responsibilities by combining three functional offices and portions of our Executive Office into two distinct offices and two new units. The review of people and resources will allow INL, as the second largest Foreign Assistance recipient to better design, monitor, assess, and track the impact of our $1.5 billion in programs. This objective aligns to JSP objective 4.1 (Workforce)."

This occasionally frustrates D&I goals, both from an initial recruitment standpoint, as well as with regards to long-range retention. Additionally, the bureau's lack of a human capital strategy contributes to adverse outcomes such as staff turn-over that demands additional resources to train and re-hire employees. These risks will be mitigated by completing the thorough review of our personnel, establishing roles, providing opportunities for training, and conducting interviews of exiting employees. INL will maintain and adhere to a Human Capital Plan and ensure that that Plan is reviewed on a routine basis."
