One of the key milestones of 2021 was the inauguration of La Samaritaine, the emblematic Paris department store, now restored to its former splendor 15 years after its closure and refurbishment. As soon as it reopened in June, this historic building once again found its place in the hearts of both Parisians and visitors to the City of Light. Since then, several million people have flocked to it, both to shop and to delight in rediscovering this French architectural landmark that LVMH has brought back to life. The Cheval Blanc Paris hotel, with its stunning views of the Seine and unparalleled service – which is without equal anywhere in the world – is also hugely successful. Its three restaurants have rapidly become essential destinations on the Paris fine-dining scene, in particular Plénitude, the gourmet restaurant run by chef Arnaud Donckele. These triumphs reflect LVMH's goal, which is to look beyond the ups and downs of 2021 at these long-term projects, patiently completed despite being delayed by the pandemic and hailed as a return to happier times as soon as they opened to the public. We live in an often uncertain world and our project schedules can sometimes encounter unforeseen twists and turns, but that only magnifies the feeling of joy when they come to fruition. So come what may, we will never shy away from undertaking ambitious projects and aiming for long-term success."

The Group is developing a comprehensive policy with the aim of ensuring that our partners and suppliers adopt best environmental, social and societal practices, while enhancing awareness and providing information about issues specific to their own activities. LVMH and its Maisons take a collaborative approach, offering support through audits and, where necessary, action plans. Over 1,500 audits were conducted in 2021. Despite the exceptional public health situation that began in early 2020, LVMH was able to maintain a significant level of on-site supplier audits. The Group's responsible sourcing policy also includes supplier support and training. For example, LVMH is a signatory of the Utthan pact, an initiative that brings together several luxury brands that contract out embroidery work. This program aims to empower artisans in Mumbai's hand embroidery cluster, where many of the embroiderers partnering with the Maisons are based. The initiative also includes a training program for embroiderers. In addition, several of the Group's Maisons worked together to organize online training for managers of supplier sites in Italy and China. Given the results of the risk analysis and of certain audits, these training courses focused on human rights, health and safety, the environment and fighting corruption."

In support of the arts, LVMH signed on to sponsor a new production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, directed by Ivo van Hove. With its performances interrupted by the pandemic lockdown, this play was presented again in 2021, once again thanks to the support of LVMH. LVMH has been a loyal patron of the Nuit Blanche night-time arts festival for nearly fifteen years, and once again in 2021 provided support alongside the City of Paris to the French and international arts scene, giving center stage to contemporary artists at an event open to all in the heart of Paris. LVMH also continued its support for the Giacometti Institute in Paris, helping it develop its scientific and cultural program."

To reduce its impact on nature, LVMH has chosen to have its plant and animal supply chains certified to the highest standards for protecting biodiversity and animal welfare, and has prohibited the sourcing of raw materials in areas with a high risk of deforestation and desertification. LVMH is also taking action to restore biodiversity, with the ambitious target of restoring 5 million hectares of flora and fauna habitat by 2030.

To achieve this goal, LVMH has developed new solutions tailored to each sourcing channel's specific features, and together with Prada Group and Cartier (a subsidiary of Richemont) announced the launch of the Aura Blockchain Consortium: a unique, global blockchain solution, open to all luxury brands worldwide to address shared challenges in responsible sourcing. LVMH has also chosen to participate in certification systems that ensure that ethical, environmental and social standards are met at each step of a material's processing, including GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and RWS (Responsible Wool Standard) for cotton and merino wool, and RJC CoC (Responsible Jewellery Council Chain-of-Custody) certification for precious metals such as gold. Rigorous traceability is also key to being able to collect reliable data, accurately measure a product's environmental performance and share this information with customers, especially as the Group has set a target of ensuring each product is covered by an information system by 2030. Putting this idea into practice by making all its supplier data available online, Fendi achieved a very significant increase in its ranking in the Fashion Transparency Index in 2021.

It is based on the following targets: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption at its sites and stores by \\(50\\%\\) by 2026 (baseline: 2019); and reducing Scope 3 emissions (raw materials, purchases, transport, waste, product use and end of life) by \\(55\\%\\) per unit of added value by 2030 (baseline: 2019). The Group has identified a number of key vectors to achieving these targets, which are covered by specific action plans rolled out at all of its Maisons, including having all sites and stores use only renewable or low-carbon energy by 2026, shifting toward shipping more freight by sea and by road, and launching a green e-commerce program and a materials innovation policy focused on Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, the climate roadmaps for the Group's Maisons were reflected in new policies on logistics, supply chains and packaging. Starting in 2023, Hennessy will transport four million bottles between France and the United States via sailing cargo ships through a partnership with Neoline, a maritime transport company; the Fashion and Leather Goods Maisons (Berluti, Christian Dior Couture, Fendi, Kenzo and Louis Vuitton) are focusing on certified or recycled materials with a reduced carbon impact, while Guerlain, Parfums Christian Dior and Givenchy offer refillable or significantly lighter packaging: for example, refills for Christian Dior's fragrance Sauvage use less glass, reducing the related greenhouse gas emissions by \\(56\\%\\). In fall 2021, LVMH and SAVE Energies (France's second-largest buyer of biomethane) entered into a three-year partnership to replace the Group's fossil fuel consumption in France with green gas, allowing 14,000 metric tons of \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\) equivalent emissions to be avoided each year starting in 2023. At COP26, LVMH had the opportunity to present and share news of these achievements, along with the roll-out of regenerative farming practices, which, by improving soil quality, also help maximize its carbon capture potential."

The occasion brought together the heads of some 40 Maisons alongside Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LVMH, at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. Each Maison was represented by a pairing consisting of its President and a virtuoso of one of the Maison's flagship trades. The LVMH Métiers d'Excellence initiative also raised its profile in Paris and Florence with its \"SHOW ME\" event featuring the Maisons' virtuosos and apprentices from the Institut des Métiers d'Excellence. Japan also welcomed its first class of LVMH Institut des Métiers d'Excellence students."

This involved specific measures to protect biodiversity and soil, such as discontinuing the use of herbicides and planting trees at its vineyards. Moët Hennessy also partnered with Reforest’Action. Planting hedges and individual trees creates pockets of biodiversity, which attract birds and insects and fight certain diseases naturally. Ruinart has already restored 40 hectares and planted over 10,000 trees in the Champagne-Ardenne region alone. In the Cognac region, Hennessy planted over 15,000 trees from 30 different species, spanning more than 4 km of hedges. The Maison set a target of replanting more than 1,000 km of hedges by 2030. Moët Hennessy also committed to preserving wooded areas in danger across the globe, including in Kenya, South Africa and China. This will cover 50,000 hectares by 2030."

Louis Vuitton strengthened its ties with the world's most prestigious sporting events: the trophy cases for the 2023 Rugby World Cup to be held in France, the Monaco Grand Prix Formula 1 race and the Davis Cup tennis tournament were custom-made by the Maison's craftspeople at its Asnières workshop, while its partnership with the NBA continued. Its range of fragrances was expanded with the Extrais collection, composed of five scents whose bottle was designed by Frank Gehry, and the Spell On You fragrance showcased in a video starring Léa Seydoux. At its stores and through its original, high-quality digital initiatives, the Maison continued to offer its customers a unique experience. The store network was expanded with the inauguration of an emblematic store in Tokyo and the opening at La Samaritaine Pont-Neuf in Paris. Committed to making its products ever more sustainable, particularly by focusing on repairability from the very beginning of the design process, the Maison also stepped up its efforts to reduce their environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle. The LV/Pillow leather goods collection and the sustainable Felt Line in Menswear were two illustrations of this approach in 2021. The Vendôme"

Capturing the spirit of the Maison, he restyled its hallmark bourgeois dress codes - small checked jackets, roomy blouses, Triomphe leather handbags with golden chains - by adding a sporty, masculine twist with hoodies, parkas, sailor jeans, boaters and fedoras. Celine's new High Perfumery ambassador, Lalisa Manoban, along with the Maison's other brand ambassadors - Kaia Gerber, Diana Silvers and Suzanne Lindon - were in attendance and lent their elegance to the show. Reviving the French Riviera's golden age, their outfits set off by the radiant sunshine, they catwalked around Nice's architectural landmarks: down the Promenade des Anglais, past the mythical Hotel Negresco and the Villa Massena and up at the Observatory's promontory, which boasts the most spectacular views of the city and the Mediterranean."

The Dior Spa that opened at the Cheval Blanc hotel in Paris is the ultimate expression of Dior skincare and its beauty expertise. Makeup was boosted by the rollout of the refillable Rouge Dior lipstick and the launch of its transfer-proof liquid version, Forever Liquid. The acceleration in online sales continued via directly operated sites, spurred by digital campaigns that were among the most innovative run by fragrance and beauty brands. These initiatives complemented the Maison's store network by attracting a new clientele and showcasing the exceptional products and customer experience it offers. Parfums Christian Dior carried on its tradition of artistic partnerships, including the collaboration with India Mahdavi for J'adore, and exhibitions showcasing its rich heritage and wealth of creativity. The Maison began sharing its values and initiatives"

Innovation, the quality-driven development of distribution networks – directly operated stores in particular – and new digital inroads will drive momentum over the months to come. Tiffany & Co. will roll out its Knot collection worldwide following its success in the United States. At the end of 2022, the Maison will reopen its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York, and will hold a major exhibition in London. Bulgari will continue to add to its core collections, showcasing its exceptional expertise in high jewelry and high-end watchmaking while continuing to develop its digital presence. In preparation for future growth, a project to extend the Valenza watch manufacturing facility will be launched in 2022. Major exhibitions will be held by Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred. TAG Heuer will develop its iconic lines and launch new high-end models inspired by its partnership with Porsche. Hublot will focus on its Big Bang flagship line in particular, and will unveil several original new designs."

Among the jewelry featured was the legendary Tiffany Diamond, making Beyoncé only the fourth person to wear it since its discovery in 1877.

In watches, growth was driven by Serpenti Seduttori, Octo Finissimo (which won the Aiguille d'Or grand prize at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix) and Bulgari Aluminium. The Maison's performance was all the more remarkable given the limited recovery in international travel and its increasingly selective presence at multi-brand stores.

They are mainly sourced from five countries: Botswana, Canada, Namibia, Russia and South Africa. All of the gold, silver and platinum used to manufacture products is also traceable to the mine or the recycler. In 2021, the Maison purchased its first Fairmined-certified gold from mines in Peru. Lastly, for colored gemstones, the Maison published the Colored Gemstone and Pearl Source Warranty Protocol in 2021 to serve as a practical, operational tool shared with suppliers to help them improve traceability as well as their social and environmental practices."

For components that need to be replaced, it uses historic spare parts from its exceptional stock of original supplies. Lastly, a certificate of authenticity of the timepiece is issued, and a single copy is printed. It is filled out by hand by the Heritage Department and signed by the watchmaker in charge of its restoration, ensuring the watch's traceability for generations to come."

The case is water-resistant to 120 meters and fitted with the state-of-the-art self-winding calibre 26-330 S C movement. These 170 exceptional timepieces epitomize the two Maisons' shared values - a quest for excellence and a passion for craftsmanship. One of the pieces was sold at auction and all the proceeds were donated to global environmental nonprofit, The Nature Conservancy."

In the United States, the implementation of its partnership with Kohl's will help amplify its success with an expanded presence and a closer connection to American customers. The Maison will continue investing to sustain its strong momentum in other strategic markets such as the Middle East and Canada, as well as to expand its retail network in major cities and scale up its digital strategy. In 2022, DFS' priority will be placed on tourism at its key destinations: Hainan, Macao and potentially Hong Kong in the second half of the fiscal year. Partial air traffic recovery forecasts – which are more favorable, with the exception of China – will be closely monitored to ensure that reopenings are in line with local authorities' requirements and the return of travelers. Highlights planned for 2022 include the second phase of the Mission Hills site opening in Hainan and the inauguration of a T Galleria in Queenstown, New Zealand, while preparing for the 2023 opening of the Brisbane location in Australia. Le Bon Marché will continue to capitalize on its unique profile as a trend-setting department store and cultural venue. In January, the Su exhibition by artist Mehmet Ali Uysal will invite viewers to reflect on climate issues. The beginning of the year will also see the launch of a digital platform for services and experiences, building on Le Bon Marché's strengths and underscoring its privileged position as an integral part of the Parisian scene."

The nonprofit has been running HIV awareness campaigns since 2003 and supports people who are HIV-positive with healthcare and food, also providing education and training for the youngest. The flower brooches were sold throughout the event and the proceeds were donated to Dessine l'Espoir."

It is now instantly recognizable by its undulating glass façade designed by 2010 Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architecture studio Sanaa. Its 1907 Eiffel-designed glass dome, enameled lava Art Nouveau decor, and monumental staircase have all been restored. As well as highlighting the store's eclectic and rich historical heritage with an innovative architectural feature, the overhaul also saw all the buildings certified to the strictest environmental standards. Designed and operated by DFS, the new Samaritaine department store promises visitors a bold blend of experiences, enchantment, authenticity and modernity. Some 600 brands converge in this exceptional space, which celebrates French elegance and art de vivre."
