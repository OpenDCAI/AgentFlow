Popular methods for learning task-oriented dialogues include applying reinforcement learning with user feedback on supervised pretraining models. Efficiency of such learning method may suffer from the mismatch of dialogue state distribution between offline training and online interactive learning stages. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid imitation and reinforcement learning method, with which a dialogue agent can effectively learn from its interaction with users by learning from human teaching and feedback. We design a neural network based task-oriented dialogue agent that can be optimized end-to-end with the proposed learning method. Experimental results show that our end-to-end dialogue agent can learn effectively from the mistake it makes via imitation learning from user teaching. Applying reinforcement learning with user feedback after the imitation learning stage further improves the agent's capability in successfully completing a task."

Comparing to chit-chat dialogue models that are usually trained offline using single-turn context-response pairs, task-oriented dialogue model involves reasoning and planning over multiple dialogue turns. This makes it especially important for a system to be able to learn from users in an interactive manner. Comparing to SL models, systems trained with RL by receiving feedback during users interactions showed improved model robustness against diverse dialogue scenarios (Williams and Zweig, 2016; Liu and Lane, 2017b)."

A potential drawback with such pre-training approach is that the model may suffer from the mismatch of dialogue state distributions between supervised training and interactive learning stages. While interacting with users, the agent's response at each turn has a direct influence on the distribution of dialogue state that the agent will operate on in the upcoming dialogue turns. If the agent makes a small mistake and reaches an unfamiliar state, it may not know how to recover from it and get back to a normal dialogue trajectory. This is because such recovery situation may be rare for good human agents and thus are not well covered in the supervised training corpus. This will result in compounding errors in a dialogue which may lead to failure of a task. RL exploration might finally help to find corresponding actions to recover from a bad state, but the search process can be very inefficient."

This user corrected dialogue sample, which is guided by the agent's own policy, is then added to the existing training corpus. We fine-tune the dialogue policy with this dialogue sample aggregation (Ross et al., 2011) and continue such user teaching process for a number of cycles. Since asking for user teaching at each dialogue turn is costly, we want to reduce this user teaching cycles as much as possible and continue the learning process with RL by collecting simple forms of user feedback (e.g. a binary feedback, positive or negative) only at the end of a dialogue."

This system is a supervised learning model which is evaluated on fixed dialogue corpora. It is unknown how well the model performance generalizes to unseen dialogue state during user interactions. Our system is trained by a combination of supervised and deep RL methods, as it is shown that RL may effectively improve dialogue success rate by exploring a large dialogue action space (Henderson et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017)."

Their model focuses on bringing differentiability to the KB query operation by introducing a \"soft\" retrieval process in selecting the KB entries. Such soft-KB lookup is prone to entity updates and additions in the KB, which is common in real world information systems. In our model, we use symbolic queries and leave the selection of KB entities to external services (e.g. a recommender system), as entity ranking in real world systems can be made with much richer features (e.g. user profiles, location and time context, etc.). Quality of the generated symbolic query is directly related to the belief tracking performance. In our proposed end-to-end system, belief tracking can be optimized together with other system components (e.g. language understanding and policy) during interactive learning with users."

Alternatively, an n-best list of API calls can be generated with the most probable candidate values for the tracked goal slots. In interfacing with KBs, instead of using a soft KB lookup as in (Dhingra et al., 2017), our model sends symbolic queries to the KB and leaves the ranking of the KB entities to an external recommender system. Entity ranking in real world systems can be made with much richer features (e.g. user profiles, local context, etc.) in the back-end system other than just following entity posterior probabilities conditioning on a user utterance. Hence ranking of the KB entities is not a part of our proposed neural dialogue model. In this work, we assume that the model receives a ranked list of KB entities according to the issued query and other available sources, such as user models."

A small mistake made by the agent due to this covariate shift (Ross and Bagnell, 2010; Ross et al., 2011) may lead to compounding errors which finally lead to failure of a task. To address this issue, we propose a dialogue imitation learning method which allows the dialogue agent to learn from human teaching. We let the supervised training agent to interact with users using its learned dialogue policy \\(\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)\\). With this, we collect additional dialogue samples that are guided by the agent's own policy, rather than by the expert policy as those in the supervised training corpora.

The red curve \\((\\mathrm{SL} + \\mathrm{RL})\\) shows the performance of the model that has RL applied on the supervised pre-training model. We can see that interactive learning with RL using a weak form of supervision from user feedback continuously improves the task success rate with the growing number of user interactions. We further conduct experiments in learning dialogue model from scratch using only RL (i.e. without supervised pre-training), and the task success rate remains at a very low level after 10K dialogue simulations. We believe that it is because the dialogue state space is too complex for the agent to learn from scratch, as it has to learn a good NLU model in combination with a good policy to complete the task. The yellow curve \\((\\mathrm{SL} + \\mathrm{IL}500 + \\mathrm{RL})\\) shows the performance of the model that has 500 episodes of imitation learning over the SL model and continues with RL optimization. It is clear from the results that applying imitation learning on supervised training model efficiently improves task success rate. RL optimization after imitation learning increases the task success rate further. The blue curve \\((\\mathrm{SL} + \\mathrm{IL}1000 + \\mathrm{RL})\\) shows the performance of the model that has 1000 episodes of imitation learning over the SL model and continues with RL. Similarly, it shows hints that imitation learning may effectively adapt the supervised training model to the dialogue state distribution during user interactions."

Each judge is asked to read a dialogue between our model and user simulator and rate each system turn on a scale of 1 (frustrating) to 5 (optimal way to help the user). Each turn is rated by 3 different judges. We collect and rate 100 dialogues for each of the three models: (i) SL model, (ii) SL model followed by 1000 episodes of IL, (iii) SL and IL followed by RL. Table 3 lists the mean and standard deviation of human scores overall system turns. Performing interactive learning with imitation and reinforcement learning clearly improves the quality of the model according to human judges."

We propose a hybrid learning approach for such systems using end-to-end trainable neural network model. We present a hybrid imitation and reinforcement learning method, where we firstly train a dialogue agent in a supervised manner by learning from dialogue corpora, and continuously to improve it by learning from user teaching and feedback with imitation and reinforcement learning. We evaluate the proposed learning method with both offline evaluation on fixed dialogue corpora and interactive evaluation with users. Experimental results show that the proposed neural dialogue agent can effectively learn from user teaching and improve task success rate with imitation learning. Applying reinforcement learning with user feedback after imitation learning with user teaching improves the model performance further, not only on the dialogue policy but also on the dialogue state tracking in the end-to-end training framework."
