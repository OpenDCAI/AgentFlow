ECA will also look to include geographically and socially isolated audiences and exchange participants. The increase in virtual and hybrid models has long made training and evaluation an ongoing Bureau priority. Academic and professional partnerships with foreign exchange participants bring international networks to American campuses and workplaces and expand the expertise of U.S. participants who go abroad. International students studying in the United States directly contribute to the U.S. economy through an influx of funds for tuition, housing, and related expenses. Nearly 70 percent of these costs are borne by the international students, their families, foreign governments, and/or other foreign entities. By expanding participation in additional training and support mechanisms for underrepresented U.S. institutions and communities in programs and activities, ECA answers the INSSG's and JSP Objective 3.2's call to address structures, policies, and practices that contribute to inequalities in educational access, outcomes, and beyond and advance equity, accessibility, and rights for all."

Increased foreign competition, economic pressures, and perceptions of safety are factors that influence demand for international exchange and that are difficult to mitigate. Exchange participants often prefer to attend more well-known institutions and could reject opportunities in underserved institutions. Participants from underrepresented backgrounds may have economic and social pressures that prevent them from participating in exchanges, including a perceived fear of lack of acceptance or support in foreign communities. Limited internet access and personal devices for some target foreign audiences make expanding new programming models difficult. Virtual and hybrid encounters with public diplomacy program participants cannot take the place of in-person experience, especially in traditional cultures.

The Bureau constantly seeks greater diversity and inclusion in its programs and its staff so that our work truly represents the American people. We achieve this goal through more collaboration – both within the bureau and with other entities in the department. We achieve greater efficiency in the use of U.S. taxpayer funding with the full implementation of a data management system, Vision 21, and the bureau-wide monitoring framework, MODE. We are constantly seeking to improve the health and safety of traveling exchange participants, especially in times of global pandemics."

As these systems are used to track administrative and program performance, the delay means that ECA may need to make decisions based on recent – not real-time – data. In addition, both systems rely on the two units within ECA to provide the data. For the information to be more effective, more ECA staff should become familiar with how to access, view, and interpret the data from these systems. Acquiring new IT resources faces budget uncertainties as well as staff adoption and skilled use in a demanding program environment."

As the global pandemic demonstrated, conditions for safe travel and in-person programs can have infinite variations, so those responsible for this aspect need the best technical and training resources.
