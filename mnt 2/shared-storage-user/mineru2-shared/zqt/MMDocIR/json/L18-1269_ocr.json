Hence, high-quality universal sentence representations are highly desirable for a variety of downstream NLP tasks."

On the one hand, people have measured performance on intrinsic evaluations, e.g. of human judgments of word or sentence similarity ratings (Agirre et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2016b) or of word associations (Vulic et al., 2017). On the other hand, it has been argued that the focus should be on downstream tasks where these representations would actually be applied (Ettinger et al., 2016; Nayak et al., 2016). In the case of sentence representations, there is a wide variety of evaluations available, many from before the \"embedding era\", that can be used to assess representational quality on that particular task. Over the years, something of a consensus has been established, mostly based on the evaluations in seminal papers such as SkipThought (Kiros et al., 2015), concerning what evaluations to use. Recent works in which various alternative sentence encoders are compared use a similar set of tasks"

For the MLP classifier, we tune the dropout rate and the number of hidden units in addition to the L2 regularization. We do not observe any improvement over Logistic Regression for methods that already have a large embedding size (4096 for Inferent and 4800 for SkipThought). On most transfer tasks, supervised methods that are trained directly on each task still outperform transfer methods. Our hope is that SentEval will help the community build sentence representations with better generalization power that can outperform both the transfer and the supervised methods."

In future work, we plan to enrich SentEval with additional tasks as the consensus on the best evaluation for sentence embeddings evolves. In particular, tasks that probe for specific linguistic properties of the sentence embeddings (Shi et al., 2016; Adi et al., 2017) are interesting directions towards understanding how the encoder understands language. We hope that our toolkit will be used by the community in order to ensure that fully comparable results are published in research papers."
