In addition, even though there is no regulatory requirement, a majority of new passenger cars in Australia are being sold with AEBS or lane keeping assist. Crash avoidance and pedestrian recognition equipment used to be mandatory for vehicles used in mines in the Russian Federation; however, the regulations were repealed in December 2020.

In addition to the safety of non-autonomous vehicles, the UAE's 2030 vision focuses on operating autonomous vehicles. Among other things, its Autonomous Vehicles Infrastructure will include pedestrian crossings that warn pedestrians with a vehicle approach alert. China's autonomous vehicles rules require test vehicles to pass a closed-road test, which includes testing the function \"pedestrian and non-motor vehicle detection and response.\""

On the specific subject of protection of pedestrians, French domestic regulations simply require new vehicles to fulfill the conditions laid out in the EU's Regulation (EC) No. 78/2009, which in turn requires vehicles to include a brake assist system and frontal protection system. This EU regulation also states that, upon assessment by the European Commission, vehicles equipped with collision avoidance systems may not have to fulfill some of the otherwise mandated test requirements."

These EU rules are transposed into Turkish law by a series of regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry and Technology (MIT). The MIT, as Turkey's approval authority under EU rules, has delegated the evaluation and certification of type approvals to the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE). Currently, the Turkish type approval framework does not specifically require the installation of car crash avoidance systems in any categories of vehicles, reflecting the EU rules in force. However, installation of such systems will be required in vehicles carrying passengers and goods following the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2019/2144, and the MIT regulation transposing the Regulation, on July 6, 2022."

The EU framework provides the technical specifications a manufacturer of motor vehicles must satisfy in its whole-vehicles, vehicle systems, components, or separate technical units that it manufactures in order to obtain an EU type approval for these products.[9] An EU type approval allows the manufacturer to market these products, and an importer to import them, within the EU and within the EU-Turkey Customs Union without needing to recertify in each member state.[10] The EU framework incorporates specific technical standards issued by the European Commission and certain technical regulations created by the UNECE; some series of UNECE regulations are considered equivalent and acceptable alternatives for compliance with EU standards for type approvals and free movement of approved products.[11]"

Information is shared with other member states using approved intelligence networks. Enforcement activity is carried out through reacting to complaints, testing of products at approved test facilities, monitoring of information and products at point of sale, and monitoring of advertisements. The form of enforcement action used will differ depending on the nature of the non-compliance, the harm caused and the history of the responsible person or business. DVSA are therefore not restricted to taking the least formal enforcement action in the first instance and will consider what immediate action is needed to protect consumer interests, including where necessary, prosecution.[18]"
