The variety of flavors the liquids come in are intended to taste good, and the flavors differentiate the liquids from approved medicinal products used as smoking cessation aids that contain only menthol and nicotine. In addition, the liquids do not contain the dosage instructions typical of medicinal products.

The Act requires their manufacturers and sellers to obtain government approval. No such approval regarding e-cigarettes has been granted yet. However, the Act does not require approval for the importation of pharmaceutical products and medical devices by individuals for private use. E-cigarettes not containing nicotine are not regulated. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare warns about the health risks of e-cigarettes on its website."

Nevertheless, depending on the item, the government may exempt an individual from proving this if the quantity imported is no more than a two-months' supply for one person.[6] In the case of pharmaceuticals classified by the Enforcement Ordinance of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act as poisonous or deleterious drugs,[7] the standard quantity for the exemption is up to one month's supply for a person.[8] Nicotine salt is classified as a poisonous or deleterious drug, depending on its concentration level.[9] Therefore, up to one month's supply of it for vaping qualifies for the exemption.

In addition, the Ministry planned to conduct a study of patients with severe lung disease who visited hospitals and emergency rooms and were e-cigarette users. The Ministry also planned to review cases of side effects of e-cigarette use reported to the Consumer Protection Agency. Further, the Ministry planned to examine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Vitamin E Acetate, which are suspected to be the cause of lung disease.[26]"

The current policy of the Government of Turkey is that the use, sale, and advertisement of e-cigarettes are regulated under the legal framework set for the use, sale, and advertisement of tobacco products. The Government also appears to accept, theoretically, that under the current legal framework, e-cigarettes may be imported as medical devices, provided that their safe use in nicotine cessation therapies is demonstrated to the Ministry of Health. Similarly, the Government's position regarding refills appears to be that e-cigarette refills containing nicotine may be produced and imported as human medicinal products, provided that they are licensed by the Ministry of Health. However, the Government maintains that use of refills (whether or not they contain nicotine) also would be subject to the limitations provided in the legal framework concerning the use, sale, and advertisement of tobacco products. The Government reports that no license or importation permit has been issued for any e-cigarette or refill product so far, and the Ministry of Health has reiterated its position on many occasions that it does not view e-cigarettes as a safe and proven method for nicotine cessation."

In response to two parliamentary questions addressed to the Minister of Health on whether or how e-cigarettes were regulated under the laws then in force,[5] the Ministry responded that nicotine-containing e-cigarette refills were subject to the relevant licensing and control framework as medical products. In contrast, e-cigarette devices, regardless of whether they are used with nicotine-containing refills, were classified as medical devices, as they are used for the intake of active substances, and could be imported and were subject to free movement (within the European Union (EU)-Turkey customs union) without any additional importation license, provided they were recorded in the National Database of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices by their manufacturers or importers, bore a \"CE\" sign, and had received the relevant EC Design-Examination Certificate.[6] However, the Ministry added that, at that time, no nicotine-containing refills had been licensed and no e-cigarette devices were registered for legal importation; moreover, the Ministry pointed out that the (now defunct) Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority (TAPDK) found that e-cigarettes, whether or not nicotine refills are used, should be regulated as tobacco products due to \"having the inhalation and stylistic characteristics of a cigarette,\" in effect, making them subject to the prohibitions on use in public places that are applicable to ordinary tobacco products provided in Law No. 4207.[7] The Ministry supported this position by claiming that cigarettes were now designated as tobacco products under the provision of the Law, which, following its amendment in May 2013, states: \"[A]ll water-pipes and cigarettes that do not contain tobacco but are used in a manner imitating tobacco products are considered tobacco products.\"[8]"
