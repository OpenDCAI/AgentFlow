Once a proposal to update the Hotlist is put forward, a Notice to Stakeholders is issued approximately three months before a 60-day consultation period on proposed updates.[35] In this amount of time, Health Canada expects manufacturers and importers to determine which of their products might be affected by a possible update. If they have products that might be affected, during this time they can start planning changes to their \"product formulations, distribution and sale.\"[36] After the 60-day consultation period, but before it publishes the final revised version of the Hotlist, Health Canada will evaluate the comments it received and respond to them.[37] Health Canada publishes the revised hotlist on the official website. Additionally, Health Canada will send the updated list to subscribers to the Cosmetics Mailing List,[38] as well as those who have previously submitted a CNF.[39] The last update to the Hotlist was made in December 2019.[40]"

The MHLW may not grant a license when the structure and equipment of the manufacturing facility do not comply with established standards under the Ministry Ordinance or when the applicant is not qualified because of a record of violation of the Act in the past, among other things. For example, the facility standards for manufacturers of general quasi-pharmaceutical products require, among other things, appropriate space, lighting, and ventilation for the manufacturing facility. The facility must also have equipment or instruments for the prevention of dust accumulation and the intrusion of insects and mice, wastewater treatment, and sanitizing workers. The separate requirements under the facility standards apply to the work space used for weighing raw materials, preparing pharmaceuticals, and filling containers. While the MHLW is authorized to conduct an investigation into whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the standards, it may delegate these investigations to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)."
