Twenty-one years later, the terrorist threats we face are more ideologically diverse and geographically diffuse than ever before. At the same time, the United States is confronting a dynamic range of national security challenges, including strategic competition, cybersecurity threats, and climate change. Therefore, to confront evolving and emerging terrorist threats within the context of broader national security priorities, the United States is entering a new era of counterterrorism, one increasingly rooted in diplomacy, partner capacity building, and prevention, and recognizing successful counterterrorism efforts require use of the full range of counterterrorism tools and a whole-of-government and whole-of-society counterterrorism approach."

Through U.S. leadership, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (Defeat-ISIS) raised more than \\(600 million in pledges to support stabilization projects in liberated areas of Iraq and Syria and established the Africa Focus Group (AFFG) to provide a mechanism for direct engagement with African Coalition members on addressing the threat of ISIS affiliates on the African continent. The United States designated three ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) leaders, including Emir Sanaullah Ghafari, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, in response to the August attack on Kabul International Airport, which killed at least 185 people — including 13 U.S. servicemembers supporting evacuation operations — and injured more than 150 others. The United States also completed nine designations against al-Qa'ida (AQ)-linked individuals and entities and offered a reward of up to \\(\\$7\\)million for information leading to the location or identification of Abu Ubaydah Yusuf al-Anabi, the leader of the terrorist organization AQ in the Islamic Maghreb. Additionally, the United States increased diplomatic engagement across the globe to counter Iran-backed Hizballah's destabilizing activities, with more countries using their national authorities to designate, ban, or otherwise restrict the terrorist organization. The United States released its first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which includes a focus on transnational Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism (REMVE). To that end, the United States, in partnership with the United Kingdom and the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IJJ), launched the first-ever criminal justice practitioner's guide on countering REMVE. The United States, partnering with Norway, also launched a Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) effort to develop a GCTF REMVE Toolkit for policymakers and practitioners that will build on the IJJ's REMVE guide."

Further, the United States continued to make notable gains in a high-level diplomatic campaign to counter Hizballah's terrorist and other illicit activities. In May, Austria banned the use or display of any Hizballah-related symbols, building on the previous ban that was limited to symbols of Hizballah's so-called military wing. In November, Australia announced its intention to expand its domestic designation of Hizballah by declaring the group in its entirety a terrorist organization. Through U.S. diplomatic efforts, 15 countries have now designated, banned, or otherwise restricted Hizballah, applying their national authorities over the past several years."

In September, the 30-member GCTF adopted a Strategic Vision for the Next Decade and new framework documents that provide the international community with tools to prevent terrorist travel and enhance border security measures; address terrorist financing related challenges; and develop capacity to investigate and prosecute terrorist actors.

Terrorists routinely manipulated intercommunal disputes by supporting longstanding claims against other groups to gain support for terrorist operations. These actors continued to carry out attacks on military outposts; kidnap or attack western private citizens and humanitarian workers; attack churches, mosques, and schools teaching western curricula; and assassinate civil servants and politicians. African countries, as well as regional and multinational organizations, sustained counterterrorism efforts against terrorist groups throughout 2021."

The trial evidence revealed no alarming uptick in radicalization or insurgent activity within Senegal's borders. At the same time, the case results showed that much work remains. Five of the nine defendants were acquitted, two by agreement of the prosecutor, which suggests inadequate investigations and insufficient evidence. Moreover, all nine of the defendants — including those ultimately acquitted — waited as many as five years in pretrial detention before their cases were heard.

UNOCT maintains a small team in Khartoum to liaise with Sudanese authorities, UN entities (including UNDP, UNESCO, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission Sudan), and regional organizations (AU and IGAD) to share best practices for counterterrorism strategy, border security, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, and community policing."

Counterterrorism has risen in importance for the Government of Tanzania, as Tanzania faces terrorist threats within the country and along three of its borders — Kenya (from al-Shabaab), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (from ISIS-DRC), and Mozambique (from ISIS-M). ISIS-M presents a significant danger to individuals in Tanzania, especially those who live along its shared border with Mozambique. Tanzania-Mozambique cross-border security cooperation began to materialize in 2021 through multilateral engagement — primarily with coordination provided by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC); however, bilateral cooperation will be important for securing Tanzanian citizens and territory."

Most incidents involved attacks against soft targets and public spaces, such as a March suicide bombing at a church in Indonesia and a bus attack in the Philippines that killed four persons in June. CT pressure and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have reduced opportunities for radicalization to violence through more traditional, person-to-person networks and increased the phenomenon of radicalization online as many people spent more time at home and online. The pandemic and corresponding increases in time spent online also has exacerbated the problem of misinformation and disinformation, particularly online, and allowed terrorists greater opportunities to gain new adherents on the internet and inspire violence. REMVE continues to be a concern for Australia and New Zealand. Governments in East Asia and the Pacific voiced concerned about the possibility of Afghanistan attracting a new wave of foreign terrorist fighters."

Most recently, the Working Group developed a Gender and P/CVE Policy Toolkit for presentation to other GCTF Member States at the Forum's 20th Coordinating Committee and 12th Ministerial meeting. In 2021, Australia's ambassador for counterterrorism led whole-of-government consultations with regional partners in Southeast Asia, which strengthened operational relationships and provided technical assistance. Australia also participated (with the United States, India, and Japan) in the second Quad counterterrorism tabletop exercise in November, hosted by India. Australia continues to engage with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners and in ASEAN-related fora on counterterrorism and law enforcement cooperation, including technical and regulatory assistance to develop and implement counterterrorism legislation. For example, Australia and the United States in February co-hosted with the Philippines the second virtual workshop in a three-workshop series for ASEAN Regional Forum members on watchlisting, aviation security, and information sharing. The Australian Federal Police works with policing agencies in Southeast Asia."

Chinese law enforcement claimed to have limited ability to freeze funds and investigate banking transactions, and no corporate transparency regulations exist. China piloted a central bank-backed digital currency known as the eCNY, or eCNY Digital Currency Electronic Payment, to deter use of other virtual currencies, among other objectives. The People's Republic of China also increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial sector by making improvements to the anti-money laundering framework. However, serious shortcomings persisted in effective implementation and ensuring transparency, particularly in the context of international cooperation."

Despite the United States' 2021 determination that People's Republic of China authorities in Xinjiang have committed genocide and crimes against humanity and strong condemnations from many other countries, China continued to defend its policies in Xinjiang and obstructed access to the region by international observers. In October, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Spokesperson Xu Guixiang stated: \"The so-called Xinjiang-related issues are not ethnic, religious, or human rights issues at all, but antiviolence, antiterrorism, anti-infiltration, antiseparation, and anti-interference issues.\" Under the pretext of counterterrorism efforts, the People's Republic of China used existing domestic laws to actively screen, monitor, and censor its citizens on the internet."

The revised guidelines require financial institutions to apply additional due diligence and risk mitigation measures for cross-border correspondent relationships in the securities sector, such as determining through publicly available information whether the respondent institution has been subject to targeted financial sanctions or regulatory actions and obtaining senior management's approval before establishing cross-border correspondent relationships. The guidelines also prohibit financial institutions from establishing or continuing a cross-border correspondent relationship with a shell financial institution."

Macau is neither a hub nor a target for international terrorist groups or extremists and maintains highly efficient security services. The stringent travel restrictions put in place by the Macau government because of the COVID-19 pandemic further reduced the likelihood of foreign terrorist threats to the city. Macau is one of the most successful and popular destinations for gambling globally and is geographically close to countries with known domestic and foreign terrorism issues, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. When international travel returns to normal levels, the city will potentially be a nexus for facilitating terrorism financing or location for terrorist activities. The Police Intervention Tactical Unit (UTIP) branch of the Macau Public Security Police Force is responsible for CT issues. UTIP's responsibilities include protecting important installations and dignitaries and IED deactivation. Macau cooperated internationally on counterterrorism efforts through INTERPOL and other security-focused organizations. Despite these efforts, Macau and its law enforcement apparatus could be a stronger partner on counterterrorism and other security challenges, including providing more information related to terrorism financing and associated activities."

The government maintained that while the ATA expands the government's authority to investigate and prosecute terrorists, it will not use such powers against human rights defenders. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled the ATA constitutional except for two provisions. One stricken provision allowed the government to arrest protesters if they endanger the public; the court ruled the provision to be overly broad and too easily abused. The second allowed the government to consider one a terrorist based solely on determinations by the UN Security Council, without the need for the government to make its own determination."

In May the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers appointed an interagency working group to draft the new strategy, which is still under way. In March the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Security formed an interagency coordination body to develop a plan for the repatriation, prosecution, or reintegration of alleged FTFs and their family members in Iraq and Syria. The Coordination Body was finalizing the whole-of-government plan at the end of 2021. The Ministry of Security CT Section increased staffing with the appointment of an assistant minister and a new head of CT. The State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) continued to be the lead law enforcement unit performing CT functions; however, its effectiveness was limited owing to poor cooperation with the State Prosecutor's Office (SPO) and, at times, poor investigatory practices. Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have clear regulations and guidelines that govern cooperation among prosecutors, law enforcement, and the intelligence community in national security investigations. The SPO and SIPA continued to receive training provided by the Department of State's ATA program; by the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training program (OPDAT) and DOJ's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program; and the U.S. Department of Defense's Special Operations Command Europe."

In 2021, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives completed its programming to prevent and counter violent extremism programming.

A UN peacekeeping force patrols a buffer zone, also called the “Green Line,” that separates the two sides. The buffer zone is largely open to civilian traffic and remains a significant route for the illicit transit of persons, narcotics, and other contraband. The division of the island has impeded counterterrorism cooperation between the two communities and between the Republic of Cyprus and Türkiye, which do not maintain diplomatic relations. This report covers only the Republic of Cyprus. It does not address terrorism or counterterrorism efforts in the areas under the administration of TCs."

Denmark continued to strongly support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including the Global Counterterrorism Forum, NATO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, INTERPOL, Club de Berne, and the European Counterterrorism Center. Denmark also is among the founding members of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition and is in the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter-ISIS Finance, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups. Denmark continued to lead the NATO Mission Iraq in 2021. Throughout 2021, Denmark continued to contribute personnel to the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali and the French-led counterterrorism mission in the Sahel. Denmark also contributed troops to the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan before withdrawing in June."

The terrorism situation in Georgia in 2021 remained quiet and stable. Georgia took further action to secure its border and arrested five Georgian citizens on ISIS-related terrorism charges in 2021. Updated counterterrorism financing legislation came into force in Georgia, and the country worked to update its National Counterterrorism Strategy and Action Plan. Far-right groups carried out violence against journalists and activists during a Tbilisi Pride event July 5. The groups also destroyed an opposition protest site at Parliament, attempted to storm Parliament, and attacked NGO offices. LGBTQI+ activists described feeling hunted, as the locations where they sought refuge were discovered by far-right groups. These events occurred after the prime minister called the planned Tbilisi Pride event “inappropriate.” Throughout the day, the Ministry of Internal Affairs failed to deploy riot control measures. Despite the arrest and later conviction of 28 perpetrators, no group leaders or organizers of the violence have been held legally responsible."

Greece also passed legislation denying furloughs to those serving in minimum security prisons and early release for convicted terrorists. The creation of the Passenger Information Unit (PIU) as the fifth department in the intelligence division of the Hellenic Police has been successful. The adoption of Automated Targeting System-Global (ATS-G), including access to U.S.-sourced terrorism screening data, constitutes a significant border security upgrade. The PIU began receiving airline data from almost two dozen airlines in 2021 and expects to add an additional 12 airlines soon. Since Greece's national identification card remains vulnerable to alteration and photo substitution, Greek authorities moved forward in the process to provide citizens with biometric-enabled ID cards. Five consortia bid on the Ministry of Citizen Protection's $566 million tender for an integrated online system for security documents, including the new ID cards. The tender is stuck in a drawn-out process and legal challenges by some companies; however, it is expected that new ID cards will be issued in the next two years."

The National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Countering Terrorism (NCCVECT) estimated that 143 citizens of North Macedonia (excluding children) in recent years have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria, to Iraq, or both, to join terrorist groups. Of these 143 adults (133 male, 10 female), 38 were killed, 79 returned, five are believed to remain in Syria, and two are in prison or a refugee camp. Another 16 (11 men and 5 women) were repatriated, and three FTFs were deported from other countries. Authorities assessed the terrorist threat level to be \"average high,\" or medium, as ISIS members and sympathizers maintained a presence in country. In July, the government repatriated four FTFs and 19 family members."

Russia remained concerned about violent extremist Islamic groups, including those with ideological ties to ISIS and al-Qa’ida. Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul, Russia has looked to build inroads with the Taliban, both to establish influential regional footholds and out of concern that terrorism would spill over into Central Asia and the broader former Soviet space."

Serbia's Criminal Code criminalizes terrorism-related offenses, including international terrorism, incitement, recruitment, using a deadly device, destruction and damage to a nuclear facility, terrorist financing, and terrorist association. Amendments to the Criminal Code in 2019 introduced life imprisonment for acts of terrorism resulting in death and extended the application of terrorist financing to other crimes. The code also outlaws unauthorized participation in a foreign war or armed conflict, prescribing incarceration from six months to 10 years for such activities. Serbia has sentenced individuals for participating in terrorist-related activities in Syria and for participating in the Russia-Ukraine conflict in eastern Ukraine. The CT Service reported that of the 10 Serbian FTFs who have returned to Europe from Syria or Iraq, four returned to Serbia. Serbia prosecuted seven such FTFs (some in absentia), for a total of 69 years of sentencing, according to the CT Service. According to some NGOs and investigative outlets, prosecutors dealing with such cases reportedly apply different standards, with returnees from Syria facing up to 11-year sentences under terrorism-related offenses and returnees from Ukraine receiving suspended sentences for participation in a foreign armed conflict. The CT Service responded that the Criminal Code allows only those convicted of fighting with UN-designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS, may be prosecuted for terrorism-related offenses. Serbians fighting with pro-Russian groups in Ukraine — not designated as terrorist groups by the UN — were prosecuted for participation in a foreign armed conflict, according to the CT Service. Serbia lacks legislation that more broadly covers conduct related to receiving terrorist training, funding terrorist organizations, and terrorist recruitment activities."

On November 29, the union of incarcerated Basque separatist terrorists (Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa, or EPPK) announced it would no longer support public events celebrating the release of Basque Fatherland and Liberty (Euzkadi ta Askatasuna, or ETA) members who had been convicted of violent terrorist acts. The welcome-home ceremonies, known as ongi etorri, are seen by many as glorification of violence and an effort to undermine rule of law.

Türkiye continues to detain and arrest Turkish citizens — including locally employed staff at the U.S. Mission to Türkiye — and foreign citizens residing in Türkiye for alleged Gulen or terrorism-related links, often based on scant evidence and minimal due process.

Since the failed coup, the Government of Türkiye has conducted 135,916 Gulen-related operations, arrested 312,121 citizens, dismissed or suspended more than 125,000 civil servants from public office, and closed more than 1,500 NGOs for alleged Gulen movement links. Politically motivated detentions and arrests of individuals — including journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and politicians accused of supporting or aiding either the PKK or the Gulen movement — under antiterror and other laws continued in 2021."

MASAK also has decreased the time it takes to implement new UN designations from up to a month to less than 24 hours."

                "content": "The Turkish Parliament approved a new law (effective as of 2021) titled \"Prevention of Financing of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" reportedly aimed at addressing some of the significant shortcomings identified by FATF with relation to anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism. MASAK created a system to categorize Türkiye's non-profit organizations (NPOs) according to risk criteria and increased its audits of those in what it deemed to be the highest risk categories. MASAK has not publicly released its risk criteria. To date, audits have focused on NPOs working on human rights issues and vulnerable communities, particularly groups that focus on the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons. Before the passage of this new legislation, those suspected of money laundering or raising funds for terrorist groups could be charged only with support for a terrorist group or \"seeking to undermine Türkiye's constitutional order,\" which carries a six- to-15-year prison sentence upon conviction. Now, additional anti-money laundering or countering terrorism finance charges can add jail time. The indiscriminate scope of the new legal provisions on aid collection do not seem to meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality to protect freedom of association, and lack of judicial oversight to authorities could constitute serious infringement of the right of associations to conduct their own affairs. The Venice Commission and other international bodies have issued opinions and recommendations aimed at addressing these deficiencies."

ISIS fighters continued to wage a low-level insurgency in Iraq and Syria, seeking to destabilize the region, recruit new members, and regain territory. More than 10,000 ISIS fighters, including some 2,000 non-Iraqi and non-Syrian FTFs, remained in Syrian Democratic Forces-controlled detention facilities in northeast Syria. More than 70,000 associated foreign family members, most of them children, remain in humanitarian camps for displaced persons. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to present logistical challenges to repatriations, but the United States continued to encourage allies and partners to repatriate their citizens and to prosecute or rehabilitate and reintegrate them, as appropriate. Beyond Iraq and Syria, ISIS branches, networks, and supporters across the Middle East and North Africa remained active, including in the Arabian Peninsula, Libya, the Sinai Peninsula, Tunisia, and Yemen. The 85-member U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS continued its comprehensive efforts to prevent a resurgence of ISIS's so-called physical caliphate in Iraq and Syria and the activities of its branches and networks."

It also has enabled Hizballah to project its power throughout the region, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. Hizballah's presence in Lebanon and Syria continued to pose a threat to Israel. Israel continued to warn the international community about Hizballah's efforts to produce precision-guided missiles within Lebanon with Iranian assistance. Hizballah has said that it has enough precision-guided missiles for a confrontation with Israel, but it has denied missiles are being developed in Lebanon. Although Palestinian terrorist groups in the West Bank and Gaza continued to threaten Israel, Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces continued their coordination in the West Bank to constrain the ability of these organizations to conduct attacks."

Attacks were also more destructive and expanded into parts of the West Bank, such as Area A, that were previously not sullied by settler violence. In one high-profile attack in September, dozens of settlers attacked the village of Um Faggarah in the middle of the day, targeting women and children, and resulted in a four-year old Palestinian boy's skull being fractured by a large rock, which settlers reportedly threw onto him while he was sleeping."

In response, Israeli National Police and the Ministry of Defense announced a series of measures, including reform of the police unit responsible for handing far-right violent extremism in the West Bank to enable a faster response to violence by targeting hotspots. Despite these efforts, Israeli security personnel often did not prevent settler attacks and rarely detained or charged perpetrators of settler violence. Only one settler was convicted (and sentenced to 20 months in prison) in 2021, for throwing a stun grenade at a Palestinian home, injuring two and causing significant damage. Some Israeli NGOs allege IDF presence during some attacks and accuse the IDF of enabling a permissive environment by its lack of enforcement."

In October, the Specialized Criminal Court of Appeals upheld the six-year prison sentence of women's rights activist Mohammed al-Rabea. In April, the court sentenced al-Rabea under the country's counterterrorism law to six years' imprisonment, with credit for time served, and a travel ban. Detained in 2018, al-Rabea's arrest was also tied to his activism for women's right to drive and against the guardianship system. Human rights groups reported authorities used the cybercrimes law and the counterterrorism law both to monitor terrorist and extremist discourse on social media as well as to restrict freedom of expression, including by prosecuting numerous individuals under these laws on charges related to statements made on social media."

Security Belt Forces affiliated with the STC and UAE continued to play an important role in CT efforts, as they exercised control over significant parts of Aden and Abyan; however, they have also been accused of human rights abuses, including in detention facilities they operate. ISIS-Yemen has been severely degraded, and many affiliates likely have reintegrated into local militias. AQAP remained active in central Yemen, most notably in al-Bayda. When the Houthis pushed into al-Bayda, AQAP scattered to neighboring Abyan and Shabwah governorates.

Terrorist tactics showed a shift toward attacks on civilians and greater reliance on IEDs, including an explosives attack using drones on an air force base. The Indian government made significant efforts to detect, disrupt, and degrade operations of terrorist organizations. In October, the United States and India held the 18th meeting of the Counterterrorism Joint Working Group, and in November India hosted the second Quad counterterrorism tabletop exercise along with Australia and Japan."

Local researchers have estimated that up to 90 percent of charges filed under laws against terrorism and “extremism” do not involve real or planned violent acts, and in some cases appeared to be connected to political opposition activity. For example, in February, a criminal court in Atyrau placed prominent local political activist Max Bokayev on the list of people suspected of financing terrorism and extremism, barred him from public activities, and imposed restrictions on his bank accounts. Courts also continued to deliver harsh sentences for the promotion of extremism online. For example, a Shymkent court handed down sentences of seven to eight years’ imprisonment to two individuals for “propaganda of terrorism” online and “incitement of religious hatred.”"

The country remains vulnerable to transnational threats, especially in the remote south, where ill-defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free movement of people and illicit goods.

Since the beginning of 2021, the GoP has de-flagged dozens of ships for violating U.S. or UN sanctions. Through the Transnational Criminal Investigations Unit and different partnerships, Panama cooperated with U.S. authorities on several CT-related cases in 2021 and continues to lead the region in enrollments in the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP).

The lack of scanners significantly limits the GoP's ability to analyze cargo transiting the country, including at Tocumen International Airport — which has the highest number of passenger movements in the region — and entry to and exit from the Colón Free Trade Zone. Limited scanner capabilities, along with a lack of proper institutional and interagency protocols at ports, greatly increases the risk of illicit cargo transiting undetected to and through Panama. Current GoP efforts, supported by Embassy Panama City, will increase interagency information sharing and expand situational awareness in the land, air, and maritime border security environments."

In 2019, the Secretary of State designated the IRGC, including IRGC-QF, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps remains present and active in the country with the permission of President Bashar al-Assad. Assad remained a staunch defender of Iran's policies, while Iran exhibited equally energetic support for the Syrian regime.

The Assad regime released thousands of violent extremists from its prisons in 2011 and 2012, fueling a rise in terrorism within the country, in an attempt to justify its repression of the Syrian people and fracture international support for the Syrian opposition. Those very networks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian and Iraqi populations in recent years.

While BH's terrorist safe havens have been reduced owing in large part to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and clashes with ISIS-WA, ISIS-WA has continued to extend its reach, battling both government forces and those of BH. Forces from Nigeria and other members of the MNJTF (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger) continued to combat both terrorist groups, but still lack the ability to clear safe havens or to secure borders and hold and effectively administer territory regained from the militants. ISIS-WA continues to conduct — through suicide bombers, vehicle-borne IEDs, raids, ambushes, kidnappings, and other means — asymmetric attacks against civilians, military, and government personnel. It funds itself primarily by “taxing” local populations, kidnapping for ransom, and looting material."

The 2016 peace accord between the Government of Colombia and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) led to the demobilization of the majority of FARC combatants and the FARC's conversion into a political party. However, ongoing challenges to peace accord implementation and continued security vacuums have created risk for terrorist activity and attacks on civilians, security forces, and infrastructure in some areas in 2021. A troubling number of FARC members refused to demobilize, estimated at around 2,600 individuals who chose not to participate in the peace process or who have subsequently joined the dissident ranks of the Segunda Marquetalia and FARC-EP. They continued engaging in terrorist and other criminal activities, particularly in border regions and areas previously controlled by the FARC."

The United States led the successful negotiation of UNSCR 2617 (2021) that was adopted unanimously on December 27 to renew the UN/CTED mandate for another four years. The resolution focuses on the protection of human rights, inclusion of civil society, and importance of rule-of-law-based counterterrorism approaches, and it addresses new and evolving threats for the first time in a UNSCR that condemns terrorism “on the basis of xenophobia, racism, and other forms of intolerance.” Further, it recognizes the need to improve the collection, handling, preservation, and sharing of battlefield evidence; recognizes the increasing global misuse of unmanned aerial systems by terrorists to conduct terrorist attacks; and calls for a global report within one year to assess member states’ implementation of the provisions in UNSCRs 2178 (2014) and 2396 (2017) to counter terrorist travel and address the evolving threat of foreign terrorist fighters and their accompanying families. The United States also supported the negotiation of several resolutions and Presidential Statements, including one to commemorate the 20th anniversary of September 11."

In April the United States led two GCTF Exploratory Dialogues — among the first multilateral events focused exclusively on international REMVE threats and challenges. The dialogues featured keynote remarks from Acting CT Coordinator John Godfrey and were attended virtually by nearly 150 participants, representing more than 50 countries and 70 organizations and academic institutions. During two online webinars, discussions focused on varying definitions, the current REMVE landscape, current legal frameworks, and practical operational and policy responses to the REMVE threat. Speakers examined existing GCTF resources pertaining to the REMVE threat, current gaps in available resources, and how the GCTF could best address REMVE-related challenges. As a result of these dialogues, the United States partnered with Norway (a non-GCTF Member) in October to initiate the development of a GCTF REMVE Toolkit that will outline good practices in addressing the REMVE radicalization lifecycle, drawing on and complementing the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law's Criminal Justice Practitioner's Guide Addressing Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism. The GCTF REMVE Toolkit will be developed through a series of virtual seminars and workshops and presented to the GCTF's 21st Coordinating Committee in September 2022 for review and adoption."

The U.S. Department of State funds INTERPOL counterterrorism-related programs through INTERPOL's General Secretariat and INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau (USNCB) of the U.S. Department of Justice, to help countries affected by the FTF phenomenon provide access to I-24/7 to frontline officials. By extending these connections beyond a country's national central bureau to strategic, high-volume airports, seaports, and land ports of entry — as well as other government agencies with investigative responsibilities — national authorities are better enabled to identify, deter, and interdict FTFs and other transnational criminals. Acknowledging the value of this initiative and the importance of addressing connectivity gaps in countries at risk of FTF travel, in 2016 the G-7 pledged to extend I-24/7 connectivity to 41 priority countries by the end of 2021. Since that pledge, the U.S. Department of State has engaged INTERPOL through the USNCB to help fulfill the G-7 commitment by providing funding for projects aimed at extending connectivity in 19 countries."

However, few repatriations took place during 2021, and human rights and humanitarian groups continue to criticize the inaction of EU member states to repatriate their citizens.

In January, it issued a draft revision of the Europol Regulation that would allow, for the first time, Europol to establish lookouts in the EU's Schengen Information System for use by EU border and police authorities. The regulation is expected to be adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2022. In June the Regulation on Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online entered into force, requiring service providers operating in the EU to remove content within one hour of notification by a competent authority in the EU. Also in June, the Commission published its Strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen Area, outlining plans to improve border management within the EU. In December it proposed an update to the Prüm Decision that would further codify cross-border law enforcement cooperation in EU law and establish a consistent, EU-operated technical infrastructure for the exchange of data under Prüm. This step, if approved, will bring Prüm, first adopted in 2006, more in line with the EU's recent interoperability efforts. Despite these improvements, the EU's constantly evolving data privacy framework also continues to make law enforcement and border security cooperation between EU member states and non-EU countries, including the United States, more challenging."

The two-year program is funded by the European Peace Facility to train 11 companies of Mozambican marines and commandos to serve as a quick reaction force to terrorist threats. The EU also continued six military and law enforcement capacity building missions in the Horn of Africa, the Central African Republic, and the Sahel, working closely with U.S. elements in counterterrorism, border security, and stabilization efforts. To date, the EU has pledged almost $270 million for the G-5 Sahel Joint Force, a coalition of five West African nations providing border security and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel. The EU has also initiated the Partnership for Stability and Security in the Sahel to assess the security sector in West African countries and coordinate donor funding to fulfill their needs."

NATO formally updated the Counterterrorism Action Plan (CTAP) with continued emphases on awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations. The United States continued to invest foreign assistance resources to support implementation of the CTAP. With this support, NATO strengthened criminal justice actors' ability to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate terrorism cases and enhance civilian-military coordination in the Middle East and North Africa through a Battlefield Evidence training at the Stability Policing Center of Excellence in Vicenza, Italy, from November 29 through December 3. In June, Allies endorsed a Strengthened Resilience Commitment to continue to take a whole-of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of Allies' societies and achieving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil-military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagements with Allies' populations, the private sector, and non-governmental actors; and the centers of expertise on resilience established by Allies.

The ICAO's involvement during the crisis in Afghanistan progressed from issuing guidance to avoid Afghanistan's airspace to tackling the technical issues that culminate in the safety and security of civil aviation. The 2020 Council of ICAO approval of amendments to Annex 9 of the Chicago Convention establishing new Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) regarding states' development and use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) systems took effect in February. These SARPs are a direct response to UNSCR 2396 of 2017, which requires states to develop the capability to collect, process, and analyze PNR data, in furtherance of ICAO SARPs.

Countering radicalization and recruitment to violence is an essential counterterrorism tool. The U.S. government's strategy to minimize the impact of terrorism and violent extremism includes efforts to build the capacity of local actors to address their drivers at the source. CVE requires a comprehensive rule-of-law-based and human-rights-respecting approach involving national and local governments, religious leaders, civil society, educators, women, youth, the private sector, and affected communities. In 2021, through bilateral and multilateral engagement, the Counterterrorism Bureau (the CT Bureau) emphasized four key areas in strategy formulation, diplomatic engagement, and foreign assistance programming: 1) countering racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism; 2) countering the use of the internet for terrorist purposes; 3) rehabilitation and reintegration of foreign terrorist fighters and associated family members; and 4) strategic messaging. The CT Bureau partnered with government officials, community leaders, NGOs, mental health professionals and social workers, religious figures, and others to build a prevention architecture to counter radicalization and recruitment to violence."

In November, the CT Bureau participated in high-level site visits to Tirana, Albania, and to Kosovo to see the newly launched rehabilitation and reintegration (R&R) initiative in the Western Balkans. The CT Bureau also supported GCERF's efforts to establish a Regional Accelerated Funding Panel consisting of national governments, the donor community, and key actors in the R&R landscape to ensure effective coordination and impact in the Western Balkan region. Additionally, GCERF continued to increase its international donor base and contributions, with Niger joining as both a donor and recipient country. Since GCERF's inception five years ago, 17 international donors have provided roughly $150 million for the organization, complementing U.S. contributions of about $21 million. In 2021, Niger became the first partner and donor country for GCERF. To date, several private sector organizations have provided in-kind contributions. Estimated conservatively, GCERF projects have reached 2.2 million direct beneficiaries and 13.2 million indirect beneficiaries. GCERF launched its 2021-25 Replenishment Campaign, led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Through this campaign, GCERF aims to raise an additional $120 million to provide better alternatives for two million people directly at risk of radicalization and recruitment, and to build a safety net among 10 million other people in their communities in more than 20 countries."

Saudi authorities worked closely with the United States to implement counterterrorism commitments and remained eager to enhance defense and security cooperation with the United States, including on countering violent extremism (CVE) issues. Regular high-level consultations and cooperation with the United States played a crucial role in the Saudi government's ability to address domestic and regional terrorism threats, and U.S. government-implemented programs helped Saudi Arabia increase its capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist threats. Saudi Arabia maintained adequate legal frameworks, security forces, and institutional preparedness to combat extremist threats. The main threat was the Iran-backed, Yemen-based Houthis, whose cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia totaled over 400 in 2021, more than double the number of attacks in 2020. Saudi Arabia remained a regional leader in countering terrorist financing, hosting the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center that brings together the United States and Persian Gulf region partners to confront new and evolving networks and lead efforts on anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing measures."

The Saudi government made further progress in revising textbooks used in the public K-12 curriculum to reduce intolerant and extremist content. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call, and Guidance issued circulars to every Saudi mosque that included a directive to remove extremist literature and a prohibition on proselytizing. In contrast, antisemitic language was used in several Friday sermons at the Two Holy Mosques. Social, legal, economic, and political discrimination against the country's Shia minority continued. The Saudi government's potential use of terrorism laws to prosecute political dissidents remained a concern."

The goal of the Strategy is to achieve a world where education systems in partner countries enable all individuals to acquire the education and skills needed to be productive members of society. To accomplish this goal, the U.S. government has two principal objectives: 1) improve learning outcomes; and 2) expand access to quality basic education for all, particularly marginalized populations. The U.S. government recognizes that its investments in international education serve as a force multiplier for all its work in international development. Strengthening education systems in developing countries advances U.S. foreign policy goals, promotes U.S. and international security, and helps accelerate economic growth at home and abroad."

Shekau maintained a group of followers and affiliates concentrated primarily in the Sambisa Forest; this faction became known as BH, while al-Barnawi's group separated and was designated as ISIS-West Africa. On May 19, 2021, Shekau was reportedly killed during a clash with ISIS-West Africa."

The military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) — the New People's Army (NPA) — is a Maoist group formed in 1969 with the aim of overthrowing the government through protracted guerrilla warfare. NPA's founder, Jose Maria Sison, reportedly directs CPP/NPA activity from the Netherlands, where he lives in self-imposed exile. Luis Jalandoni, a fellow Central Committee member and director of the CPP's overt political wing, the National Democratic Front, also lives in the Netherlands. Although primarily a rural-based guerrilla group, the CPP/NPA has an active urban infrastructure to support its terrorist activities and, at times, has used city-based assassination squads."

The RIRA has historically sought to disrupt the Northern Ireland peace process and did not participate in the 2005 weapons decommissioning. Despite internal rifts and calls by some jailed members (including the group’s founder Michael “Mickey” McKevitt) for a cease-fire and disbandment, the RIRA has pledged additional violence and continued to conduct attacks. Many RIRA members are former Provisional Irish Republican Army members who left the organization after the group renewed its cease-fire in 1997. These members brought extensive experience in terrorist tactics and bomb making to the group."

Formed in 1982 following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Lebanon-based radical Shia group takes its ideological inspiration from the Iranian Revolution and the teachings of the late Ayatollah Khomeini. The group generally follows the religious guidance of the Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Hizballah is closely allied with Iran, and the two often work together on shared initiatives, although Hizballah also occasionally acts independently. Hizballah shares a close relationship with the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and, like Iran, provides assistance — including fighters — to Syrian regime forces in the Syrian conflict."

In late 2004, Zarqawi joined al-Qa'ida (AQ) and pledged allegiance to Usama bin Laden. At that time, his group became known as al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQI). Zarqawi led the group in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom to fight against U.S. and Defeat-ISIS Coalition forces until his death in 2006."

ISIS was led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared an Islamic caliphate in 2014, but he was killed in 2019. In 2017 the U.S. military fighting with local Syrian allies announced the liberation of Raqqa, the self-declared capital of ISIS's so-called caliphate. Also in 2017, then-Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi announced the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq. In 2018 the Syrian Democratic Forces, with support from the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, began a final push to oust ISIS fighters from the lower Middle Euphrates River Valley in Syria. The year 2019 marked the full territorial defeat of ISIS's so-called caliphate; however, ISIS in Syria remains a serious threat. The group benefits from instability, demonstrates intent to cause attacks abroad, and continues to inspire terrorist attacks around the world."

The territorial defeat of ISIS that eliminated its control of territory in Syria in 2019 reduced ISIS's ability to generate, hold, and transfer its financial assets.

Its offshoot, Kahane Chai (translation: “Kahane Lives”), was founded by Meir Kahane’s son Binyamin, following his father’s 1990 assassination. In 1994 the Israeli government banned both Kach and Kahane Chai, declaring them terrorist organizations. The Cabinet’s decision was based on evidence, submitted by Israeli security services and police, that implicated the two groups in a series of unsolved murders of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The banning followed the 1994 massacre of 29 Palestinians in Hebron by a Kach activist."

These figures were acquired through consular systems. Embassies and consulates abroad report overseas deaths in consular systems and specify the cause of death. Terrorism-related deaths are evaluated by first collecting those data and then contacting posts individually to determine whether there is sufficient official documentation to designate the death as terrorism related. These figures may not reflect actual numbers of injured, which may not always be reported, depending on the severity of injuries and other factors. In the cases of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, it is particularly difficult to gather comprehensive information about all incidents and to distinguish terrorism from the numerous other forms of violence."
