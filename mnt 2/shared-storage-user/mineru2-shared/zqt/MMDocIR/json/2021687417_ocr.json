Eight EU member states have passed their own legislation in addition to the directly applicable regulation, including two that have set an earlier target date. To date, 11 countries outside the EU have passed legislation containing a net zero emissions goal, with two setting a target date earlier than 2050. At least three other countries have introduced or are expressly developing legislation that includes the goal."
