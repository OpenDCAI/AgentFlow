This historic commitment, launched in 2003, is the largest by any nation to combat a single disease internationally. U.S. government leadership, through PEPFAR, transformed the global HIV/AIDS response, accelerating progress toward controlling and, ultimately, ending the AIDS epidemic. PEPFAR's mission is to support countries to achieve sustained epidemic control of HIV by supporting equitable health services and solutions, enduring national health systems and capabilities, and lasting collaborations. Key risks to successful execution of PEPFAR's mission and protection of HIV gains include continued negative impacts as a result of COVID-19, or other threats including civil unrest or environmental disasters."

Through the use of strategic HIV testing approaches and differentiated HIV service delivery (DSD) models, we will work to improve access, ART continuity, and health outcomes for those we serve. DSD models, including using technology not only enable PEPFAR to tailor the way in which we support services to better meet the needs of our clients but also to lessen unnecessary burdens on the health care system, permitting them to be more responsive to other health needs and resilient in the face of adversity. PEPFAR will ensure the majority of clients it supports are healthy and virally suppressed allowing them to lead long lives and contribute to societies and economies. PEPFAR will continue to adapt care models to meet their evolving needs in managing a chronic disease."

Supported with continued PEPFAR financial and technical assistance, robust and transparent data systems will enable partner countries and communities to rapidly adapt policies and programs to better meet the needs of clients and respond to emerging threats. PEPFAR uses a variety of tools and data streams to monitor progress including the Sustainability Index and Dashboard (SID) which plots progress towards a functional HIV response system and the \"Table 6\" process that charts PEPFAR investments and outcomes in systems investments. Since system progress requires multiple year investments, SIDs are reviewed biannually while Table 6s are reviewed annually."

Success relies on building meaningful and wide-ranging partnerships with the private sector at global and local levels. Scalability and sustainability of programs is more likely to be achieved with support of and collaboration with the private sector. To achieve this, PEPFAR deploys good governance practices so accountability, oversight, and responsibility are transparent to all parties. These practices include the use of instruments such as signed MOU's, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and the deployment of governance structures such as steering and oversight committees. In addition, PEPFAR programming builds on tried and tested mechanisms to implement partnerships such as known and vetted implementing partners who receive U.S. government financing, including local entities. Private sector partners and foundations fund their own partners, while the USG funds its partners and a common MOU directs the partnership towards common goals and the desired impact. Lastly, PEPFAR is wedded to measurement, so these partnerships have monitoring and evaluation throughout, with routine oversight and clearly funded metrics."
