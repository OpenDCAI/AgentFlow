Three groups of women in STEM jobs stand out as more likely to see workplace inequities: women employed in STEM settings where men outnumber women, women working in computer jobs (only some of whom work in the technology industry), and women in STEM who hold postgraduate degrees. Indeed, a majority of each of these groups of STEM women have experienced gender discrimination at work, according to a nationally representative Pew Research Center survey with an oversample of people working in STEM jobs."

The field of study for master's, professional and doctorate degrees is not collected. For respondents who hold a bachelor's degree in more than one field, the Census Bureau data include both the first and second fields listed. We classify college majors as STEM if either the first or second field of study is computers, mathematics and statistics; engineering; biological, agricultural and environmental sciences; physical and earth sciences; or health-related. The National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators 2016, chapter 3, reports that about \\(75\\%\\) of adults with at least one degree in a science and engineering field also have their highest degree in a science and engineering field.
