While it can be used in many positive ways to solve global challenges, there are also security risks to be considered, such as fundamental rights infringements, personal data security, and harmful uses. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has identified three dimensions to the relationship between cybersecurity and AI. First, there is the cybersecurity of AI, meaning a lack of robustness and the vulnerabilities of AI models and algorithms. Second, AI can also support cybersecurity when it is used as a tool or means to create advanced cybersecurity, such as by developing more effective security controls and by facilitating the efforts of law enforcement and other public authorities to respond to cybercrime. Lastly, there is the malicious use of AI, meaning when AI is used in a harmful, malicious, or adversarial way to create more sophisticated types of attacks.<sup>1</sup> This report focuses on the first dimension."

Whereas the EU intends to adopt its legislative proposal for a specific Artificial Intelligence Act (draft AI Act) by the end of 2023 and the Canadian government introduced an Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) in June 2022, other surveyed jurisdictions have not yet advanced similar legislation. Both Australia and New Zealand do not currently have laws or proposed specific laws related to AI. However, a May 2023 discussion paper published by the Australian government seeks public feedback on possible policy and regulatory responses to AI, including the adoption of a risk-based approach similar to the EU draft AI Act. Likewise, the UK has not passed AI-specific legislation and does not intend to do so currently, but might at a later stage \"enhance regulatory powers, ensure regulatory coordination, or create new institutional architecture.\" Currently, there are 18 legal frameworks containing over 50 pieces of legislation that touch upon AI in the UK. Figure 1 below depicts types of AI-related legislation by jurisdiction."

Australia and New Zealand have several technology-neutral general statutes and guidance documents that address aspects of cybersecurity that are not specific to AI systems. In the UK, an impact assessment found that there are \"key gaps in the UK's current legal frameworks relate[d] to individual rights, safety standards specific to AI, transparency, human involvement, accountability, and rights to redress.\""

First, the Government recognizes that Canadians have concerns about the risks associated with this emerging technology and need to know that the Government has a plan to ensure that AI systems that impact their lives are safe. The recently published Report of the Public Awareness Working Group of the Advisory Council on AI reveals significant interest among Canadians in the opportunities offered by AI, but also concerns regarding potential harms. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believed that AI has the potential to cause harm to society, while \\(71\\%\\) believed that it could be trusted if regulated by public authorities. Thus, we aim to reassure Canadians that we have a thoughtful plan to manage this emerging technology and maintain trust in a growing area of the economy. At the same time, AI researchers and innovators are concerned by the uncertainty that exists regarding future regulation. Recognizing that the regulation of this powerful technology is now an emerging international norm, many in the field are worried that regulation will be inflexible or that it will unfairly stigmatize their field of work. Such an outcome would have significant impacts on opportunities for Canadians and the Canadian economy. This document aims to reassure actors in the AI ecosystem in Canada that the aim of this Act is not to entrap good faith actors or to chill innovation, but to regulate the most powerful uses of this technology that pose the risk of harm. Specifically, this paper is intended to address both of these sets of concerns and provide assurance to Canadians that the risks posed by AI systems will not fall through the cracks of consumer protection and human rights legislation, while also making it clear that the Government intends to take an agile approach that will not stifle responsible innovation or needlessly single out AI developers, researchers, investors or entrepreneurs. What follows is a roadmap for the AIDA, explaining its intent and the Government's key considerations for operationalizing it through future regulations. It is intended to build understanding among stakeholders and"

The Council adopted its common position (general approach) on the draft AI Act on December 6, 2022. The plenary of the EP adopted its negotiating position in its session on June 14, 2023.

It outlines four levels of risk: AI systems that pose an unacceptable risk would be completely prohibited, high-risk AI systems would be subject to detailed mandatory requirements as outlined below, limited risk AI systems would be subject to transparency requirements to alert users that they are interacting with a machine, and providers of AI systems presenting minimal or no risk would be encouraged to adopt codes of conduct or to apply the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems voluntarily.[12]"

A DPIA must specify how data will be collected, stored, and used; the volume, type, and sensitivity of the data; the relationship to the individuals whose data is held; the outcome for the individuals, wider society, and the data processor; and whether there are alternatives to AI that pose less risk and, if so, why these were not used.<sup>101</sup> Failing to conduct a DPIA can result in sanctions from the ICO."
