In order to develop such systems, it is crucial to invest in high quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks to measure progress. We present MLQA, a multi-way aligned extractive QA evaluation benchmark intended to spur research in this area.<sup>1</sup> MLQA contains QA instances in 7 languages, English, Arabic, German, Spanish, Hindi, Vietnamese and Simplified Chinese. MLQA has over 12K instances in English and 5K in each other language, with each instance parallel between 4 languages on average. We evaluate state-of-the-art cross-lingual models and machine-translation-based baselines on MLQA. In all cases, transfer results are significantly behind training-language performance."

Second, we cannot easily train end-to-end QA models on the task, and arguably most recent successes in QA have been in fully supervised settings. Given recent progress in cross-lingual tasks such as document classification (Lewis et al., 2004; Klementiev et al., 2012; Schwenk and Li, 2018), semantic role labelling (Akbik et al., 2015) and NLI (Conneau et al., 2018), we argue that while multilingual QA training data might be useful but not strictly necessary, multilingual evaluation data is a must-have."

Highly parallel data is particularly attractive, as it enables fairer comparison across languages, requires fewer source language annotations, and allows for additional evaluation setups at no extra annotation cost. A purpose-built evaluation benchmark dataset covering a range of diverse languages, and following the popular extractive QA paradigm on a practically-useful domain would be a powerful testbed for cross-lingual QA models."

We introduce the following modifications for fairer multilingual evaluation: Instead of stripping ASCII punctuation, we strip all unicode characters with a punctuation General_Category. When a language has stand-alone articles (English, Spanish, German and Vietnamese) we strip them.

Other evaluation setups could be envisioned, e.g. by exploiting the target language development sets for hyperparameter optimisation or fine-tuning, which could be fruitful for higher transfer performance, but we leave such \"few-shot\" experiments as future work. Other potential areas to explore involve training datasets other than English, such as CMRC (Cui et al., 2018), or using unsupervised QA techniques to assist transfer (Lewis et al., 2019)."

G-XLT represents an interesting testbed, as simple symbolic matching is less straightforward when questions and contexts use different languages. However, the performance drop from XLT is relatively small (8.2 mean F1), suggesting word-matching in cross-lingual models is more nuanced and robust than it may initially appear."

Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation."

We chose the 5 most common wh* words in the dataset for this analysis. We see that “when” questions are consistently easier than average across the languages, but the pattern is less clear for other question types. “Who” questions also seem easier than average, except for Hindi, where the performance is quite low for these questions. “How”-type questions (such as “how much”, “how many” or “how long”) are also more challenging to answer than average in English compared to the other languages. “Where” questions also seem challenging"

The F1 scores for different answer types relative to overall F1 score are shown for various Named Entity types in Figure 8. There are some clear trends: Answer spans that contain named entities are easier to answer than those that do not (the first two rows) for all the languages, but the difference is most pronounced for German. Secondly, \"Temporal\" answer types (DATE and TIME entity labels) are consistently easier than average for all languages, consistent with the high scores for \"when\" questions in the previous section. Again, this result is most pronounced in German, but is also very strong for Spanish, Hindi, and Vietnamese. Arabic also performs well for ORG, GPE and LOC answer types, unlike most of the other languages.

We then evaluated the mean F1 score for each language on the two subsets, with the results shown in Figure 4. We see that questions that are \"easy\" in English also seem to be easier in the target languages, but the drop in performance for the \"hard\" subset is not as dramatic as one might expect. This suggests that not all questions that are hard in English in MLQA are hard in the target languages. This could be due to the grammar and morphology of different languages leading to questions being easier or more difficult to answer, but an another factor is that context documents can be shorter in target languages for questions the model struggled to answer correctly in English, effectively making them easier. Manual inspection suggests that whilst context documents are often shorter for when the model is correct in the target language, this effect is not sufficient to explain the difference in performance."

Additionally, most of these sentences are the first sentence of the article, or are uninteresting. However, if we choose 4-way parallel sentences, there are plenty of sentences to choose from. We sample evenly from each combination of English and 3 of the 6 target languages.
