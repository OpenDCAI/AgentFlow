To succeed, CDP must engage and upskill staff across the Department. In addition, CDP must elevate the Department's role in the Interagency to develop and implement U.S. cyberspace and digital foreign policy, assistance, and messaging. CDP will look to strengthen coordination with USAID in the areas of digital development and diplomacy while also seeking to foster interagency collaboration by developing clear lines of communication and coordination across different agencies and departments involved in U.S. cyber and digital policy.
