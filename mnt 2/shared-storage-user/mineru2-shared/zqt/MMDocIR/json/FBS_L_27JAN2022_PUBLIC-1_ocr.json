For example, L continues to develop and explain the international legal justification for the United States' global counterterrorism efforts, including its efforts to degrade and ultimately defeat groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda. Moreover, L regularly advises on sensitive law enforcement and intelligence-related matters and develops legal options across the foreign policy spectrum, including with regard to domestic and multilateral sanctions and trade policies, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, bilateral and multilateral treaty regimes, and litigation and arbitration risks and opportunities. L also supports Department management by providing critical legal advice on domestic operations, including expenditure of assistance and operating funds; provision of consular services, including passport and visa operations; public diplomacy initiatives, including countering terrorism and violent extremism; buildings and acquisitions issues; and employment and ethics matters."

Such ongoing efforts to mitigate litigation exposure for the Department require exceptional legal expertise and sustained resources."

Without L's input on major international events including natural disasters, health emergencies, and conflict situations, the Department risks not fully taking into account its obligations under international law. As a leader on the world stage, our international partners expect that the United States always operates well within the letter of international law and will provide leadership and a firm legal foundation during crisis and conflicts situations. L also provides substantial legal counsel to consular professionals, who adjudicate millions of visa and passport issuances and refusals annually and advises Department principals on politically sensitive international child abduction cases and complicated adoptions of foreign-born children by American citizens, among other high-profile consular and management-related issues. L is an essential partner in supporting the Department's management operations by providing legal advice on a wide range of matters, including the provision of consular services; border security; buildings and acquisitions; U.S. diplomatic and consular operations abroad."

It is imperative that the Department consult L and follow L's advice in order to limit liability and ensure compliance with applicable law. L is also an essential partner in supporting the Department's management operations of personnel systems for employees, including the Foreign Service, Civil Service, and Locally Engaged Staff; security of personnel and information technology; issues regarding privileges and immunities; public diplomacy programs aimed at countering violent extremism; promulgation and implementation of regulations and directives; all manner of domestic and foreign litigation involving the Department; ethics and financial disclosure matters; and information law.

Notably, only \\(54.4\\%\\) of employees felt that their workload was reasonable and only \\(22.1\\%\\) of respondents felt that senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce. Management has recognized for some time that the legal workloads in the Office of the Legal Adviser are rigorous and are not compatible with maintaining high morale and motivation year over year. Nominal staffing levels leave little capacity making much needed career training, travel, interagency and overseas assignments difficult to accommodate. For these reasons, L has developed a new management goal to help foster an outstanding work environment to address morale issues."
