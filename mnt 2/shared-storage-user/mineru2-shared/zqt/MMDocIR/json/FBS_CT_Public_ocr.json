Al-Qa'ida (AQ) and its affiliates continue to constitute a threat, despite suffering significant leadership losses. ISIS and AQ continue to exploit conflict zones and under-governed spaces in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, and beyond.

U.S. assistance strengthens partnerships and improves partners' capacities, to effectively address terrorist threats.

These efforts are integrated with the objectives of the D-ISIS Coalition's FTF Working Group and Africa Focus Group (AFFG), both of which provide members with information on available CT programming and advocate for its usage. In addition, CT will engage with partners on the importance of collecting, using, and processing API and PNR data in line with UNSCR 2396 and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) PNR Standards and Recommended Practices. CT will also continue to build the capacity of partner nations in focus regions to understand, manage, and cooperate on border-related terrorism challenges, such as the movement of FTFs and dangerous items across borders.

Nevertheless, the cost of inaction is far higher than the cost of action. Not achieving these objective risks enabling terrorists to abuse the international financial system and operate freely because of partner countries' inability to detect and disrupt their activities. With that in mind, CT will seek to build international support for U.S. designations to encourage broader implementation. CT also will use tools, such as the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) mutual evaluation and compliance process, to identify and leverage political will and cooperation to address terrorist financing risks and more effectively target countries for technical assistance efforts. Additionally, there is a growing perception that sanctions are having an undue negative impact on U.S. business and on the delivery of humanitarian aid."

Many partners around the world need assistance to develop the knowledge, skills, and resources in these sectors to adequately and appropriately respond.

Despite the many accomplishments over the past 20 years, terrorists have adapted, and terrorist threats continue to persist around the world. Some partners lack the counterterrorism capabilities needed – particularly civilian counterterrorism capabilities. Local counterterrorism deficiencies are proving increasingly problematic with the further geographic spread of the terrorist threat. Further developing international partnerships and coalitions allows us to build the political will and bolster partner capacity to implement international obligations and commitments. Furthermore, multilateral engagement helps provide a counterbalance to the growing challenge of great power competition. Both Russia and China are offering security and counterterrorism assistance to countries on the frontlines of the terrorist threat, particularly across Africa. U.S. engagement can strengthen alliances, help set global standards and norms that promote and protect U.S. priorities and best practices and ensure that China and Russia are not exploiting security vacuums in strategic locations."

The 2021 merger of CT with the Office of the Special Envoy to Counter ISIS, giving CT leadership of the 84-member Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, further enhanced the CT bureau's influence and reach on global counterterrorism efforts. CT plays a central role within the Department and across the interagency to ensure that U.S. counterterrorism efforts address the top global terrorist threats, are embedded in our broader foreign policy efforts and position the U.S. government to anticipate and respond effectively to future challenges. CT works with U.S. Embassies, State Department, and interagency stakeholders to shape and oversee implementation of coordinated U.S. government strategies to address priority and emergent terrorist threats. CT seeks to leverage all possible diplomatic and foreign assistance tools and partnerships to advance these strategies and undermine the enabling conditions that fuel those threats."

In addition, programs determined to be wasteful undermine public confidence in all foreign aid and over the long term may lead to Congress appropriating less funding for counterterrorism capacity building. For these reasons, CT will continue to adhere to established practices and tools for the design and oversight of our foreign assistance, as mandated by Department policy and law, to ensure programming is effective. Where applicable, CT will use monitoring and evaluation data to inform programmatic decisions, including the closure of programs deemed ineffective. To mitigate these risks, CT is requesting additional FTE positions in future budgets to ensure we have the human resources to adequately track our programs. In addition, CT is pursuing the development of an IT platform that will make the management of programs much easier."
