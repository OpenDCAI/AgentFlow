These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice."

To estimate the even greater resources required to transfer an existing model to a new task or develop new models, we perform a case study of the full computational resources required for the development and tuning of a recent state-of-the-art NLP pipeline (Strubell et al., 2018). We conclude with recommendations to the community based on our findings, namely: (1) Time to retrain and sensitivity to hyperparameters should be reported for NLP machine learning models; (2) academic researchers need equitable access to computational resources; and (3) researchers should prioritize developing efficient models and hardware."

An effort can also be made in terms of software. There is already a precedent for NLP software packages prioritizing efficient models. An additional avenue through which NLP and machine learning software developers could aid in reducing the energy associated with model tuning is by providing easy-to-use APIs implementing more efficient alternatives to brute-force grid search for hyperparameter tuning, e.g. random or Bayesian hyperparameter search techniques (Bergstra et al., 2011; Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Snoek et al., 2012). While software packages implementing these techniques do exist,[10] they are rarely employed in practice for tuning NLP models. This is likely because their interoperability with popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow is not optimized, i.e. there are not simple examples of how to tune TensorFlow Estimators using Bayesian search. Integrating these tools into the workflows with which NLP researchers and practitioners are already familiar could have notable impact on the cost of developing and tuning in NLP."
