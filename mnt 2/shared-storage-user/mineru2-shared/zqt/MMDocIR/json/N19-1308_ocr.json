The dynamic span graph allows coreference and relation type confidences to propagate through the graph to iteratively refine the span representations. This is unlike previous multi-task frameworks for information extraction in which the only interaction between tasks is in the shared first-layer LSTM. Our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple information extraction tasks across multiple datasets reflecting different domains. We further observe that the span enumeration approach is good at detecting nested span entities, with significant F1 score improvement on the ACE dataset.<sup>1</sup>"

However, most systems based on sequence labeling suffer from an inability to extract entities with overlapping spans. Recently Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018) have presented methods enabling neural models to extract overlapping entities, applying hypergraph-based representations on top of sequence labeling systems. Our framework offers an alternative approach, forgoing sequence labeling entirely and simply considering all possible spans as candidate entities."

Knowledge graph completion (Yang et al., 2015; Bordes et al., 2013) is one prominent example. For relation extraction tasks, graphs have been used primarily as a means to incorporate pipelined features such as syntactic or discourse relations (Peng et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Christopoulou et al. (2018) models all possible paths between entities as a graph, and refines pair-wise embeddings by performing a walk on the graph structure. All these previous works assume that the nodes of the graph (i.e. the entity candidates to be considered during relation extraction) are predefined and fixed throughout the learning process. On the other hand, our framework does not require a fixed set of entity boundaries as an input for graph construction. Motivated by state-of-the-art span-based approaches to coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017, 2018) and semantic role labeling (He et al., 2018), the model uses a beam pruning strategy to dynamically select high-quality spans, and constructs a graph using the selected spans as nodes."

To make the model more general, we combine the multitask learning framework with ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) without relying on external syntactic tools and risking the cascading errors that accompany them, and improve the interaction between tasks through dynamic graph propagation. While the performance of DyGIE benefits from ELMo, it advances over some systems (Luan et al., 2018a; Sanh et al., 2019) that also incorporate ELMo. The analyses presented here give insights into the benefits of joint modeling."

Unlike the joint entity and relation task in Sec. 4.1, where only the entity head span need be predicted, an entity prediction is considered correct in these experiments if both its entity label and its full text span match a gold prediction. This is a more stringent evaluation criterion than the one used in Section 4.1. As before, we use the OntoNotes annotations to train the parameters of the coreference layer."

The key contribution of our model is the dynamic span graph approach, which enhances interaction across tasks that allows the model to learn useful information from broader context. Unlike many IE frameworks, our model does not require any preprocessing using syntactic tools, and has significant improvement across different IE tasks including entity, relation extraction and overlapping entity extraction. The addition of co-reference and relation propagation across sentences adds only a small computation cost to inference; the memory cost is controlled by beam search. These added costs are small relative to those of the baseline span-based model. We welcome the community to test our model on different information extraction tasks. Future directions include extending the framework to encompass more structural IE tasks such as event extraction."
