However, the question that arises is whether a statute that would authorize less severe measures, with more protection for fundamental rights and freedoms, should be available for use in similar circumstances. In the spring of 1971, legislation was drafted dealing with civil emergencies and the government proposed the appointment of a special joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons to consider the enactment of this legislation. However, the committee was not appointed and the legislation was never introduced.[30]"
