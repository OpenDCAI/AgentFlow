The term \"wet market\" can be taken to generally refer to \"a partially open commercial complex with vending stalls organized in rows; they often have slippery floors and narrow aisles along which independent vendors primarily sell \"wet\" items such as meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and fruits.\" Such markets may or may not sell live animals and do not necessarily include wildlife or the meat or other products derived from wild animals."

The virus first infected multiple individuals working at, or visiting, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market at an early stage, initiating multiple chains of transmission that ensured sustained transmission in the human population (Yang et al., 2020). While details of the origin of the outbreak remain uncertain, significant evidence strongly links the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan with the early spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) among humans (Li et al., 2020).<sup>4</sup>"

In some cases, it was difficult to determine with certainty the existence of such markets in a country, although there were reports of wild animals or wild meat being traded to varying extents. Some countries, such as Botswana and Angola, where bushmeat is reportedly an important source of nutrition but where information on how such meat is actually commercially traded is limited, have been included in this report. In addition, examples of countries, such as Argentina and Georgia, where game meat may be sold in establishments or markets other than what might be termed traditional \"wet markets\" have been included. The following jurisdictions have also been included in an appendix to this report: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. These jurisdictions do not appear to have wet markets at which wild animals are sold for human consumption, but have laws relevant to animal protection and/or the safety of game meat."

In some countries, there may be a lack of capacity in terms of enforcing licensing or permit systems related to hunting and trading in wild meat. There may also be difficulties, and possibly reluctance on the part of authorities to enforce certain restrictions and requirements, due to the importance placed on local hunting and consumption traditions, such as in Botswana, Côte d'Ivoire, and Indonesia."

In 2020, the authorities vowed to increase inspections of wildlife breeding sites and revoke all licenses for the commercial use of wild animals for food. However, the previous experience after the end of the 2003 SARS epidemic shows that there can be problems with ongoing enforcement. Amendments to strengthen the relevant wildlife law will be considered in 2020."

There has long been a wildlife-eating culture in certain areas of China. Over the past three decades, consuming exotic foods has become a symbol of social status. In addition, in some of China's impoverished regions, wildlife farming is an important source of income for people. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicine has for centuries used various types of wildlife to treat human ailments. Scales of pangolins, for example, are used to treat conditions such as blocked breast ducts, rheumatoid arthritis, and poor blood circulation, despite no scientific evidence of effectiveness. As of 2016, China reportedly had a wildlife breeding industry that was worth an estimated 520 billion yuan (about US$74 billion) and employed more than 14 million people. These animals are used in various sectors, among them fur farming, which has the highest value, followed by food, medicine, tourism/pets, and laboratory research."

Hunting is an inherent part of the country's cultural heritage. While hunting is considered to be a popular leisure activity, game is rarely used as part of the food supply. Georgian legislation provides for animal protection and hunting is regulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture through annually issued rules for the issuance of hunting licenses, with designated times when and territories where hunting is allowed as well as the animal species that may be hunted. A dedicated wet market for wild animals does not exist in Georgia, neither in the urban areas nor in the countryside. However, wild animal products may be sold to private individuals or restaurants after obtaining a special veterinary certificate."

The most well-known market is the Tomohon Faithful Market in North Sulawesi province, which, along with other markets in the province, serves as a hub for the multi-province bat bushmeat trade. Unprotected animals, including bats, can be hunted and traded with a permit, and a quota system applies, although this system is reportedly not fully implemented or enforced. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local authorities in North Sulawesi have sought to limit the supply of wild meats and have encouraged traders and consumers to switch to other products. However, they have not closed the relevant markets."

Hunters must verify that game was obtained lawfully following the established hunting rules and submit proof that wild animals were killed in a territory with no known animal diseases. Inspection of game caught by individual hunters is conducted at the market sanitary stations. Game collected by hunting organizations or cooperatives is examined at the places of collection. The body of an animal without skin and internal organs is subject to examination. Game birds are examined with feathers but disemboweled. During the examination, attention should be paid to the meat's freshness, the animal's appearance, the nature of the wound, the level of blood remaining, and the presence of pathological changes in the animal's anatomy. In a case where good quality and freshness are in doubt, microbiological testing needs to be conducted. Bacteriological analysis is always required for the meat of boars, bears, groundhogs, nutria, and some other wild animals.[9]"

The slaughtering or washing of large animals, such as cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep or pigs, in the market is prohibited. slaughtering or cutting poultry in the market is also prohibited in the event of an influenza epidemic transmitted by birds in the locality.[9] The location of the market must be at least 100 meters (about 109 yards) away from sources that cause pollution, including waste, animal husbandry, and sewage disposal, unless the public health official has given approval due to pollution in the market being prevented.[10]"
