Together with international partners, the United States has responded to the evolving threat, including by expanding the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, which now counts 83 members. The Defeat-ISIS Coalition worked to consolidate gains in Iraq and Syria, while broadening efforts to counter the growing ISIS threat in West Africa and the Sahel. In March the United States designated the new leader of ISIS, Amir Muhammad Sa'id Abdul-Rahman al-Mawla, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). U.S.-led military operations in 2020 resulted in the deaths of Qassim al-Rimi, the emir of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and of senior al-Qa'ida (AQ) leaders in Syria. The United States continued to address threats posed by state-sponsored terrorism, sanctioning Iran-supported groups such as Iraq-based Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq and Bahrain-based Saraya al-Mukhtar. Nine countries across the Western Hemisphere and Europe took significant steps in 2020 to designate, ban, or otherwise restrict Hizballah — following the lead of four other governments that took similar actions the previous year. Reflecting the growing threat from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism (REMOVE), the Department of State also designated a white supremacist terrorist organization for the first time in 2020, imposing sanctions against the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) and three of its leaders in April."

Although ISIS lost all the territory it had seized in Iraq and Syria, the organization and its branches continued to mount a worldwide terrorism campaign, carrying out deadly attacks globally. Illustrating the evolving threat, ISIS affiliates outside Iraq and Syria caused more fatalities during 2020 than in any previous year. ISIS maintained an active presence and low-level insurgency in Iraq and Syria, with increased attacks in both countries during the first half of 2020. In South and Southeast Asia, ISIS radicalized individuals to violence, inspiring them to conduct attacks. In Africa, ISIS-affiliated groups increased the volume and lethality of their attacks across West Africa, the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin, and northern Mozambique. Deaths attributable to ISIS-affiliated attacks in West Africa alone almost doubled from around 2,700 in 2017 to nearly 5,000 in 2020. In Mozambique, an estimated 1,500 deaths were due to ISIS-Mozambique attacks."

Yet, AQ's networks continued to exploit undergoverned spaces, conflict zones, and security gaps in the Middle East to acquire terrorist resources and conduct terrorist attacks. AQ further bolstered its presence abroad, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, where AQ affiliates AQAP, al-Shabaab in the Horn of Africa, and Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslin in the Sahel remain among the most active and dangerous terrorist groups in the world. In January 2020, al-Shabaab attacked a military base shared by U.S. and Kenyan military forces in Manda Bay, Kenya, killing one U.S. servicemember and two U.S. contractors. This incident marked the deadliest terrorist attack against U.S. military forces in Africa since 2017."

In November the United States and Nigeria co-hosted the first Defeat-ISIS Coalition meeting on combating ISIS threats across West Africa and the Sahel. At this meeting, Mauritania announced its membership in the Defeat-ISIS Coalition, becoming its 83rd member and the 13th from sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the United States continued high-level diplomatic engagement to counter Hizballah across Central America, South America, and Europe. In January the United States participated in the third Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in Bogota, Colombia — a high-level process launched by the United States in 2018 to confront terrorist threats in the region.

The cash-intensive nature of Burkina Faso's economy complicates the investigation of terrorist financing activities. Terrorist groups fund their activities primarily through the trafficking of illicit goods in coordination with organized criminal groups, robbery, and kidnapping, often targeting gold mining operations, rather than through sophisticated money laundering schemes. CENTIF-BF tracks terrorist financing and refers cases to the specialized financial or terrorism courts for prosecutions. No criminal terrorist financing cases were charged in 2020, according to the CENTIF-BF chief."

Boko Haram and ISIS-WA carried out significantly more suicide attacks, compared with 2019.

BH continued employing suicide bombers and IEDs, including the first documented use of a maritime IED in Chad. BH continued to be the most active terrorist organization in Chad, and ISIS-West Africa also maintained a presence. The Chadian government remained a reliable partner of U.S. and other CT missions even as the COVID-19 pandemic depressed government revenues. Security forces and basic government services remained underfunded, which limited the Chadian government's effectiveness, but Chadian armed forces led missions within the region to maintain security in the Sahel. Chad maintained a strong commitment to fight terrorists by deploying soldiers to Mali to support MINUSMA, bolstering the Lake Chad Region's MNJTF, and committing forces to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force. Chad continued to host the French Operation Barkhane, France's CT mission for the Sahel. The United States remained the largest direct supporter of Chadian security forces."

The TPLF asserted that its actions were self-defense in the face of planned Ethiopian government action to remove it from provincial government. Since the conflict erupted, the Ethiopian government has sought and received military assistance both from the State of Eritrea and from security forces under the control of the Amhara regional government. There were credible reports implicating all parties to the conflict in human rights abuses and pointing to atrocities committed by Amhara regional security forces, Ethiopian military forces, and the Eritrean military."

A court found two men involved in this attack — Mohamed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafah — guilty of conspiracy to commit terrorism and aiding AS. The court sentenced them to prison for 33 years and 18 years, respectively. A third man, Libyan Abdullah Omar, was acquitted. Despite successes, challenges persist. Access to defense counsel for terrorism suspects is limited because the government has not fully funded the National Legal Aid Service. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been working to develop a uniform and consistent nationwide policy on plea negotiations.

Despite the extraconstitutional change in government, Mali's longstanding CT partnerships with foreign forces in country — particularly France's Operation Barkhane — continued. Terrorist activities increased in number and lethality throughout the country and continued to target civilians, Mali's Armed Forces (FAMa), international peacekeepers, and international military forces.

Reports of kidnappings and forced displacement increased substantially in 2020, particularly in coastal areas. In 2020, there were limited and irregular reports of ISIS-Mozambique distributing food and money to civilians. ISIS-Mozambique conducted increasing attacks against security forces; in the second half of 2020, more deaths resulted from force-on-force events than violence against civilians. ISIS-Mozambique fighters are frequently reported to wear police or military uniforms and use weapons and equipment stolen from security forces.

Boko Haram attacks did not discriminate between civilians and government officials, whereas ISIS-WA generally, but not always, focused attacks on government and security forces. The implementation of the Nigerian military's \"super camp\" strategy, which began in 2019, was designed to stem losses when terrorists overran forward-operating bases. As a defensive military strategy, the decision to consolidate the posture into super camps is working. However, Boko Haram and ISIS-WA have exploited the military's inability to patrol open space outside the super camps to abduct aid workers, attack humanitarian operations hubs, and degrade security along roads. The deteriorating security environment has worsened conditions for civilians and further constrained relief operations in northeastern Nigeria."

Regional dynamics remained an increasing concern as terrorist groups made gains in the South African Development Community region, including Mozambique. The South African government engaged in discussions with Mozambique on how to counter threats from ISIS and other terror groups. In July, ISIS threatened to expand its \"fighting front\" into South Africa if South Africa entered the ISIS conflict in Mozambique. The government continued to prosecute alleged terrorists charged in previous years and arrested members of an alleged white supremacist terrorist group."

While the PCLU retained an oversight role, it gave provincial prosecutors substantial autonomy to direct terrorism cases. Progress in several high-profile cases slowed as newly assigned NPA provincial prosecutors familiarized themselves with the cases and developed prosecution strategies. Affected cases included the previously reported prosecutions of the terrorist group allegedly responsible for the 2018 deadly attacks on a Shia mosque and firebomb attacks against commercial Durban interests, and the prosecutions of Sayfudeen Del Vecchio and Fatima Patel, charged in 2018 with murdering British-South African dual nationals Rodney and Rachel Saunders.

The rescission of the designation came after a political transition in 2019, when Sudan officially formed the civilian-led transitional government (CLTG) after a popular uprising ended the 30-year regime of former President Omer al-Bashir. Rescission of Sudan's SST designation was a top priority for Prime Minister Hamdok and his cabinet, who have taken critical steps to work with the United States on improving Sudan's CT efforts. Addressing a policy condition for rescission of the SST designation, the CLTG agreed to provide $335 million in compensation for victims of terrorism, to include victims of the 2000 USS Cole attack and the 1998 East African Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. As part of the SST statutory criteria, the CLTG also provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future."

The PRC's counterterrorism attention remained on ethnic Uyghur so-called extremists, specifically alleging that the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is the primary source of terrorism in Xinjiang. The United States, however, has seen no credible evidence for more than a decade that the group still exists and removed ETIM from the Terrorist Exclusion List in November based on this lack of evidence. The United States continued to list ETIM as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 to maintain compliance with its obligations under the UN 1267 Committee. Beijing inaccurately labeled the \"Turkistan Islamic Party\" (TIP) as ETIM. TIP is a violent extremist group active in Syria and Afghanistan that shares some characteristics with the PRC's description of ETIM. Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have faced extreme oppression at the hands of China's authoritarian government, which has used counterterrorism as a pretext to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. The PRC since 2017 has detained more than one million predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups in internment camps, where officials subject them to torture, forced labor, persecution, and coercive family planning, among other abuses. The PRC continued to expand law enforcement tools and enhance its military and counterterrorism capabilities to justify and improve its ability to carry out this repressive campaign, respond to threats faced as a result of the PRC's increasing global economic footprint, and garner international support for its counterterrorism-related policies."

A September State Council white paper on Xinjiang, however, lauded the PRC’s poverty alleviation efforts in Xinjiang as a successful model for combating terrorism. Throughout the year, the PRC continued to enhance and develop its military and counterterrorism capabilities as well as leverage its domestic technology sector to bolster surveillance capabilities, including for counterterrorism goals."

It engaged in a range of multilateral, regional, and bilateral fora, presenting itself as a global leader on counterterrorism. China continued to work through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure to pursue counterterrorism cooperation, including joint border operations, drills, and youth deradicalization efforts. In September, BRICS held a fifth Counterterrorism Working Group meeting and in November unveiled a new counterterrorism strategy. In bilateral and multilateral fora, the PRC cited terrorism concerns to counter international criticism of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and to justify repatriation requests and other law enforcement actions overseas. The PRC engages through bilateral channels with a variety of governments to aggressively lobby the forcible return of Uyghur and other ethnic and religious minority asylum seekers who fled repression in Xinjiang, often labeling these individuals as terrorists or violent extremists. During the year, units from the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police held CT drills with a range of countries, including the September Kavkaz-2020 multinational antiterror strategic exercise in Russia."

BNPT used former terrorists for CVE outreach campaigns and helped establish boarding schools to educate children of former terrorists. Indonesia issued a “Ministerial Joint Decree on Handling Radicalism Among Civil Servants in November 2019” and formed a dedicated task force to monitor, investigate, and report online behavior of civil servants accused of “radicalism.” On October 19, BNPT launched the Indonesia Knowledge Hub on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism (or I-KHub) digital platform to improve coordination, collaboration, cooperation, planning, and implementation of CVE programs among donors."

The Philippine government developed the ATA with assistance from the United States and other governments to criminalize predicate offenses, remove procedural obstacles to charging terrorists, and provide additional investigative tools to law enforcement. Opponents of the ATA, worried the law could be used against political rivals and human rights defenders, have petitioned the Supreme Court to invalidate the law as unconstitutional. According to human rights groups, government officials label activists and others as terrorists to silence criticism of the government or intimidate opponents in local disputes. Many such individuals are later killed or targeted with alleged politically motivated criminal charges."

However, most Western European governments were consistently reluctant to repatriate and prosecute adult citizen FTFs, citing concerns that domestic judicial proceedings would not yield convictions or long sentences for defendants and FTFs could pose a threat in their countries of origin. Over the past few years, several Western European countries revoked the citizenship of citizens who traveled to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS.

In August, Lithuania publicly declared Hizballah a terrorist organization in its entirety and banned all Hizballah affiliates from entering the country. In October, Estonia recognized Hizballah as a terrorist organization in its entirety. And in December, Slovenia designated Hizballah a terrorist organization.

Key developments in 2020 included the approval of a NATO policy on battlefield evidence and a practical framework for technical exploitation, as well as the publication of NATO's first-ever Counter-Terrorism Reference Curriculum, designed to support allies and partners in enhancing their capacities to develop national skills and improve counterterrorism strategies. The Counterterrorism Action Plan also addresses NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, its Defeat-ISIS support, and NATO Mission Iraq. Many of NATO's 40 partner countries — spanning from Mongolia to Colombia, and in particular the 11 partner nations in the Middle East and North Africa — consistently seek increased engagement with NATO on counterterrorism."

Belgium's highly devolved government structure presents challenges to effective internal communication and cooperation between Belgium's numerous law enforcement and criminal justice entities. During 2020, Belgium's Parliament did not pass any legislation that would alter Belgium's ability to investigate, prosecute, or deter terrorism. There remained hurdles to the effective use of civil informants, and Belgium's short prison sentences continued to reduce the efficacy of plea bargaining. Belgium implements UNSCR 2396, in part, through the implementation of the EU PNR directive for airport travelers, through its aggressive prosecution of known FTFs, often in absentia, and through its maintenance of databases to track known and suspected terrorists. It established the Belgian Passenger Information Unit in 2018 and has continued to add airlines and test the possibility of broadening to additional transport modes."

Lenient sentencing in terrorism cases remained a challenge, with recent sentences averaging three and a half years for terrorism-related charges. On investigations, interpersonal and interagency infighting and stove-piping undermine fully effective cooperation.

In 2020, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives completed its third year of programming to prevent and counter violent extremism. This involves small grants to bolster positive alternatives to violent extremist influences, including developing a nationwide network of youth centers to mobilize young people against division in target areas, supporting the IRC in responding to hate-based attacks, and bolstering community media outlets to challenge violent extremist narratives.

The National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Countering Terrorism (NCCVECT) estimated that 143 citizens of North Macedonia (excluding children) previously traveled or attempted to travel to Syria and Iraq to join terrorist groups. Of the 126 adults who spent time in Syria and/or Iraq, 38 were killed, 69 returned to North Macedonia, and 19 remain. Authorities assessed the terrorist threat level to be \"average,\" or medium, as ISIS members and sympathizers maintained a presence in country. In June the government adopted a national reintegration plan for FTFs and their family members."

This was a critical step in preparing for repatriation of FTFs and family members from Syria; the plan's implementation has just begun, as COVID-19 delayed implementation. A Dutch-funded project engaged families of convicted terrorist offenders to provide a clearer picture of their challenges and needs, and the International Organization for Migration used this analysis, as well as the national plan, to help inform its own Dutch- and EU-funded reintegration program."

Russia, however, also used counterterrorism and \"extremism\" as pretexts to suppress the exercise of human rights, or for other objectives in both domestic and foreign policy. Violent extremist Islamic groups, including those with ideological ties to ISIS and those consisting of fighters returning from Syria, remain a top government concern. Though the United States and Russia continued to share information on terrorist threats at the working level, the formal counterterrorism dialogue framework remained on hold because of public, unfounded statements by Russian security officials alleging U.S. support for ISIS."

The Criminal Code outlaws unauthorized participation in a war or armed conflict in a foreign country, prescribing incarceration from 6 months to 10 years for citizens who participate in foreign armed conflicts. In recent years, Serbia has sentenced individuals for participating in terrorist-related activities in Syria and for participating in the Russia-Ukraine conflict in eastern Ukraine, although the Ministry of Interior (MOI) appears to apply different standards to foreign fighters in the two conflicts, with returnees from Syria facing up to 15-year sentences and most returnees from Ukraine receiving suspended sentences.

In July, domestic and international organizations criticized an APML probe (later rebranded by APML as a “sectoral risk assessment”) of at least 57 NGOs and individuals as politicized use of AML/CFT measures to target groups critical of the government. In November the government proposed additional amendments to further improve AML/CFT measures — for example, measures related to virtual currencies.

Algerian armed forces and internal security forces published figures that showed continued pressure on terrorist groups, conducting a steady drumbeat of operations to arrest and eliminate terrorist suspects, dismantle and disrupt terrorist cells, and destroy hideouts, arms, and other equipment. These ongoing operations significantly degraded the capacities of terrorist groups to operate within Algeria. AQIM and ISIS's Algeria branch remained in the country but were under considerable pressure from Algerian security authorities. The elimination of several leaders and high-profile members of terrorist groups inside and outside of Algeria, particularly AQIM, further diminished their capacity. These groups aspire to impose their interpretations of Islamic law on the region and to attack Algerian security services, local government targets, and Western interests. Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and Tunisia — as well as human, weapons, and narcotics trafficking — contributed to the overall threat, particularly in border regions."

In December the United States and Bahrain launched the inaugural U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue, which reviewed bilateral cooperation across sectors and surveyed emerging and transnational threats. Bahrain continued to offer its support for countering Iran's malign activities in the region. Reports of mistreatment, arbitrary and unlawful detention, and security force-perpetrated abuse continued over the rating period. According to international media and NGO reports, confessions have been obtained through torture.

The offensive and subsequent three-month security operation to reestablish security and remove ISIS-planted booby traps displaced an estimated 10,000 local residents. In October the North Sinai governor released the first official Egyptian government statistics on civilian casualties in the governorate, reporting 1,004 civilian deaths and 2,800 civilian injuries over the past six years. The report did not distinguish whether civilian casualties resulted from terrorism or government CT operations, or from both.

In December, after the PA announced a resumption of cooperation with Israel, the Israeli government transferred all pending tax revenue to the PA but declared it would deduct $184 million for prisoner and martyr payments, to be prorated monthly in the coming year."

In international fora, Lebanon argued that acts taken against what it characterized as “foreign occupation” are not terrorism. This characterization was used to justify Hizballah’s acts against Israel as resistance to occupation rather than terrorism. In December the Netherlands-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon sentenced in absentia Hizballah terrorist Salim Ayyash for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

Following the failure of the self-styled Libyan National Army's (LNA's) military assault on western Libya, military officials from the Government of National Accord (GNA) and the eastern-based LNA signed a ceasefire agreement October 23. Despite the ceasefire, the volatility of Libya's security and political dynamics allowed room for terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to regroup. While ISIS-Libya controls no territory in Libya and is significantly degraded in terms of numbers and capacity, it remains a threat. The GNA was a reliable and willing U.S. counterterrorism partner, although its capacity to eliminate terrorist safe havens, counter terrorist financing, deter the flow of foreign fighters, or ensure effective counter proliferation efforts across Libya's territory was limited. The LNA countered terrorism in the East and South of the country, but its counterterrorism gains were limited to areas under its direct control. At the end of 2020, UN-facilitated talks were underway to select a new, unified interim executive authority."

Deradicalization programs in Saudi prisons and at the Mohammed bin Naif Care and Counseling Center in Riyadh remained a main feature in the reintegration of former violent extremists into Saudi society with ongoing monitoring. Saudi Arabia also supported the Jeddah-based Sawt Al-Hikma Center at the OIC in its public-messaging efforts to combat extremism. The Saudi Arabian government also operated the \"Etidal\" Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, which works with governments and other groups to combat and refute extremism."

Tunisian strides in professionalizing its security apparatus in partnership with the United States and its commitment to joint Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense (MOD) CT operations have steadily degraded violent extremist organizations' capacity within the country. Despite COVID-19 challenges' affecting national resources, Tunisia demonstrated consistent security force readiness and carried out proactive CT operations throughout the year. Tunisia continued work on implementation of a national preventing/countering violent extremism (PVE/CVE) strategy and the freezing of terrorist assets and, as evidenced by the responses to the terrorist attack near Embassy Tunis and to the Sousse attack, demonstrated improvements in CT crisis response, coordination, and investigation."

Since 2010, FATF has identified Yemen as a risk to the international financial system because of its strategic AML/CFT deficiencies, and the Republic of Yemen government has limited capacity to resolve these deficiencies. For example, the CBY in Aden sought transactional information from commercial banks for AML/CFT compliance. Commercial banks, however, resisted complying owing to Houthi pressure on their Sana'a-based bank headquarters. In November the Aden CBY referred some bank branch managers for criminal prosecution over their refusal to comply. Houthi leaders in Sana'a retaliated by dispatching security forces to seize computer servers and enforce a temporary closure of several large commercial banks. A mediated resolution saw Sana'a-based banks resume providing basic compliance information to CBY Aden, but not at the level of detail needed to meet international AML/CFT standards."

The Afghan Taliban, including the affiliated Haqqani Network (HQN), continued a high pace of insurgent attacks against the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). The Taliban also conducted attacks targeting government officials. ANDSF retained full responsibility for security in Afghanistan and, in partnership with NATO's Resolute Support Mission, took aggressive action against terrorist elements across Afghanistan. In 2020 the ANDSF and the Taliban separately maintained pressure against ISIS-K and prevented the group from reclaiming lost territory. ISIS-K continues to regroup and retains the ability to conduct high-profile attacks against civilian and government targets."

Pakistan convicted Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and four other senior LeT leaders in multiple terrorism financing cases.

Pakistan did not take action against other known terrorists such as JeM founder and UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack “project manager” Sajid Mir, both of whom are believed to remain free in Pakistan. Pakistan did make positive contributions to the Afghanistan peace process, such as encouraging Taliban reductions in violence. Pakistan made additional progress in 2020 toward completing its Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Action Plan, but did not complete all Action Plan items, and remained on the FATF “gray list.”"

However, attacks against provincial capitals and district centers declined. In addition, direct targeting of U.S. interests dropped significantly in 2020 owing to stipulations within the U.S.-Taliban agreement that prohibited Taliban attacks on foreigners.

As confidence-building measures before the launch of peace negotiations, the Afghan government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban released 1,005 Afghans it had held hostage.

In 2020 there were three specific terrorist incidents, resulting in no deaths. As in prior years, the Bangladeshi government denied Bangladesh-based terrorists have meaningful ties to transnational terror groups, including ISIS or AQIS. An appeal is pending before the Bangladesh Supreme Court following the CT Special Tribunal's 2019 sentencing of seven individuals to death for supporting roles in the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack, in which attackers claiming allegiance to ISIS killed 20 people, including one American. Ongoing deficits in Bangladesh's judicial system, magnified by the constraints of operating during a global pandemic, contribute to a decade-long backlog of terrorism cases and a conviction rate estimated at less than 15 percent. The Bangladesh government continued to articulate a zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism and the use of its territory as a terrorist safe haven. In January the government's new national Antiterrorism Unit began standing up operations, to eventually assume a role as a lead counterterrorism agency."

Working with religious experts, psychologists, and theologians, the Ministry of Information and Social Development conducted direct outreach in communities across the country; maintained an educational website on religion, state policy, and prevention of terrorism; and operated a nationwide hotline offering consultations on religious questions. At the same time, the government continued to block online content it considered extremist. In November, officials publicly reported they had deleted 25,000 \"illegal\" materials from the internet and over the course of the year limited access to 13,000 others. The government also continued to implement rehabilitation and reintegration programs for individuals convicted of extremism-related offenses and their relatives, including those repatriated from Syria and Iraq. Kazakhstan supported 17 regional rehabilitation and reintegration centers for FTFs and family members repatriated from Syria and Iraq. Aktauu and Karaganda became the first two cities in Kazakhstan to join the Strong Cities Network."

In May an Austrian court sentenced a Kazakhstani citizen to 12 years in prison for fighting with a group affiliated with the Islamic State in Syria; Kazakhstan requested his extradition, but Austria denied the request on the grounds that court proceedings in Kazakhstan would be inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights."

Terrorist attacks in the country remain rare, but reports of terrorism-related arrests in 2020 underscore the potential threat. The Kyrgyz government restricts public information on national security issues, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of its CT operations and the extent of the threat. The country remains vulnerable to transnational threats, especially in the remote South, where ill-defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free movement of people and illicit goods. According to government statistics, some 850 Kyrgyz citizens have left the country to join ISIS or other terrorist groups, but the true number is likely higher. The government faces limitations on its ability to investigate, prosecute, and rehabilitate returning FTFs owing to a lack of expertise, resources, and potential shortcomings in the legal framework."

While 2020 saw many small incidents of politically motivated violence, most incidents targeted large-scale infrastructure, government offices, or locations affiliated with political parties or officials. The Government of Nepal attributed most of the attacks to the Communist Party of Nepal, a political faction better known as Biplav, led by Netra Bikram Chand and which split from the former mainstream Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) in 2014. Nepal's security services continue to monitor the Biplav Group, an insurgent group that sometimes engages in politically motivated acts of violence to attempt to achieve its goals. Throughout the year, Biplav organized numerous nationwide protests, which were frequently accompanied by IED attacks and other forms of violence throughout Nepal. In 2021, both government and Biplav sources confirmed that they were in negotiations aimed at bringing Biplav back into the political process through its renunciation of violence. Because of the open border with India and insufficient security protocols at the country's sole international airport in Kathmandu, Nepal has and could be used as a transit or staging point for international terrorists."

Compounding the global COVID-19 pandemic, corruption, weak government institutions, insufficient interagency cooperation, weak or nonexistent legislation, and a general lack of resources remained obstacles to improving security in 2020.

The TBA is one of the principal routes into Argentina for multi-billion-dollar trade-based money laundering (TBML), counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and other smuggling operations. In addition, many of the money laundering organizations in the TBA have known or suspected links to the terrorist organization Hizballah. Argentina lacked adequate controls at points of entry to prevent cross-border transport of contraband and bulk cash, particularly with respect to outbound enforcement; however, reduced cross-border volume attributable to coronavirus restrictions netted increased seizures of narcotics and other contraband in border areas. The cash-intensive economy and large informal financial sector in Argentina created additional opportunities for criminals to launder illicit proceeds, and authorities detected numerous TBML schemes. In Mar de Plata, on December 16, the federal police arrested a Russian woman with an outstanding INTERPOL Red Notice for financing ISIS."

Cuba maintains close and collaborative ties with designated state sponsors of terror such as Iran and North Korea. Citing peace negotiation protocols signed by Colombia in 2016 that stipulated safe passage for ELN negotiators back to Colombia, the Cuban regime continued to permit ELN negotiators associated with now-defunct peace talks to reside in Cuba, despite Colombia's repeated requests for their extradition.

Paraguayan authorities officially consider the EPP and its offshoots — Mariscal López's Army (EML), and the Armed Peasant Association (ACA) — as organized criminal groups rather than terrorist organizations. However, Paraguayan leaders informally referred to the groups publicly as terrorist organizations. In September the Government of Paraguay's Joint Task Force (FTC) conducted an operation against an EPP camp, after which two 11-year-old girls were found deceased under opaque circumstances. The Government of Paraguay increased its FTC presence in the Concepcion department after the EPP Indigenous Brigade wing kidnapped former Vice President Óscar Denis on September 9; as of December 31 the government had not been able to locate Denis or Félix Urbieta, the other hostage believed still to be in EPP custody. The Government of Paraguay believes the EPP is a small, decentralized group of between 20 and 50 members. EPP's, EML's, and ACA's activities have consisted largely of isolated attacks on remote police and army posts, or against ranchers and peasants accused of aiding Paraguayan security forces. Ranchers and ranch workers in northeastern Paraguay, including members of the Mennonite community, claimed the EPP frequently threatened both their livelihoods and personal security."

In November the National Assembly passed a resolution declaring the regime’s Special Action Force a terrorist organization for its role in extrajudicial killings inside Venezuela. The democratic opposition has warned that the regime lost control of Venezuela’s borders and territory and was at risk of turning Venezuela into a “failed state.” Some members of the illegitimate Maduro regime and armed forces maintained financial ties with FARC dissidents, ELN, and Venezuelan paramilitary groups. Analysts warned of increasing border clashes between these groups over illicit trade and for territorial control, particularly on Venezuela’s border with Colombia. The ELN continued to expand its presence beyond its historic base in the border zone with Colombia and to consolidate its social control where its presence is strongest. According to local and international media, ELN was present in 12 of Venezuela’s 23 states (with particular strength in Amazonas, Anzoátegui, Apure, Bolívar, Táchira, and Zulia states). Media reported an increasing role for the ELN in state-subsidized food distribution, contraband (gas, basic goods, meat), extortion, illegal mining, and recruitment propaganda, at times through control of radio stations."

The Syrian government's awareness and encouragement for many years of terrorists' transit through Syria to Iraq for the purpose of fighting U.S. forces before 2012 is well documented. The Assad regime released thousands of violent extremists from its prisons in 2011 and 2012, fueling a rise in terrorism within the country, in an attempt to justify its repression of the Syrian people and fracture international support for the Syrian opposition. Those very networks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian and Iraqi populations in 2020. Throughout the Syrian conflict, terrorist groups in Syria have often cited the regime's egregious human rights abuses and violations to justify their activities and recruit members. The Assad regime has frequently used counterterrorism laws and special counterterrorism courts to detain and imprison protesters, human rights defenders, humanitarian workers, and others on the pretext of fighting terrorism. Additionally, Shia militia groups in Iraq, some of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations aligned with Iran, continued to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Assad regime. Affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers' Party also operated on Syrian soil and represent Turkey's primary counterterrorism concern in Syria. ISIS cells remained active in parts of Syria and launched attacks on civilians and U.S. partner forces. In October, U.S. forces completed an operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ISIS members in Syria continued to plot or inspire external terrorist operations."

In 2020 the GTR's chemical, biological, and nuclear security programs implemented dozens of capacity building projects to ensure that foreign partners could detect and counter WMD terrorism threats. To ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and to help prevent future WMD attacks, GTR leveraged virtual reality platforms to train Iraqi civil and security sectors from both the central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government to identify and neutralize potential clandestine chemical and biological weapons laboratories in Iraq. In response to the threat of transnational terrorists conducting chemical weapons (CW) attacks using unrestricted, commercially available material, GTR collaborated with security forces around the world to train law enforcement in partner countries to detect and prevent CW attacks against vulnerable transportation hubs, such as railways and subways."

As part of a core national security strategy to combat terrorist organizations, a key objective of EXBS is to provide stakeholders with substantive knowledge, skills, and tools to prevent state and nonstate actors from acquiring WMD, explosives, and conventional arms (including Man-portable Air Defense Systems and Antitank Guided Missiles), or using those materials against U.S. citizens and interests. To achieve this objective, EXBS continued to train partner governments in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Western Hemisphere regions to detect, interdict, and counter the materials, technologies, and tactics that terrorists could use to carry out low-technology attacks on public transportation. Additionally, in 2020, EXBS developed curricula for partner nation security forces to address threats posed by improvised threats, including the use of drones as delivery mechanisms and insider threats focused on the commercial aviation sector. EXBS also provided comprehensive training to Middle Eastern and North African border security officials on border security, cargo and passenger interdiction, and counter-IED training. EXBS partnered with the CT Bureau and the interagency to engage with key partners on aviation security programming. Finally, EXBS furnished equipment and training to strengthen aviation security and mitigate threats to civilian aviation, and provided land border security training for Egyptian, Iraqi, and Libyan security forces to stem the flow of illicit materials and maintain gains made against ISIS and other nonstate actors."

In April the IIT issued its first report that found reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Republic was responsible for three chemical weapons attacks in 2017. The IIT is responsible for identifying individuals or entities involved in the use of chemical weapons in certain cases, regardless of whether the perpetrators are state or nonstate actors. Also related to the 2018 Conference of the States Parties decision, the OPCW is pursuing options to further assist States Parties with preventing the threat posed by nonstate actor interest in and use of chemical weapons. Finally, the Department of State’s Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund has provided funding and personal protective equipment to support the OPCW’s TS special missions and contingency operations related specifically to Syria through the OPCW’s Trust Fund for Syria Missions."

In 2020, ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) continued to use portions of Egypt's Sinai region as a base to conduct attacks against military and civilian targets in the Sinai, though they claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt during the year. Nearly all of the estimated 212 terrorist attacks in Egypt in 2020 were in North Sinai, of which the great majority were claimed by ISIS-SP. Between January and December, 428 significant conflict events occurred in North Sinai, including 134 IED-related attacks, 153 airstrikes, and near weekly complex assaults on government-fortified positions by ISIS-SP. These events have exemplified ISIS-SP's freedom to maneuver during daytime hours and the continued expansion of its attacks westward, toward the Suez Canal Zone, and southward. In July, ISIS-SP overran and infiltrated several small villages south of Bir al-Abd, resulting in the displacement of thousands of civilians. Egyptian Armed Forces were eventually able to retake the territory though more than a dozen civilians were subsequently killed by IEDs left behind by ISIS-SP."

ISIS continued to carry out assassinations, as well as suicide, hit-and-run, and other asymmetric attacks throughout the country. The United States continued to engage with the Government of Iraq to deny ISIS access to CBRN materials. The United States worked to strengthen the expertise and ability of Iraq's government, academic institutions, and private sector to secure weaponizable chemical and biological materials and to detect, disrupt, and respond effectively to suspected CBRN activity. This included providing CBRN detection, analysis, and investigation training at internationally recognized training centers of excellence, such as the Defense CBRN Center in Vught, Netherlands, and the National Institute for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Protection in the Czech Republic. The United States and Iraq also continued their bilateral partnership to counter nuclear smuggling under the framework of the 2014 Joint Action Plan on Combating Nuclear and Radioactive Materials Smuggling."

Libya remained politically divided during the year between the Government of National Accord (GNA) and groups aligned with it and groups aligned with the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA). Terrorist groups attempted to exploit a security vacuum in the southern region of the country but were limited in their ability to do so because of tactical gains by the LNA against these groups. Throughout most of 2020, GNA-aligned groups repulsed an LNA attempt to take control of Greater Tripoli, and the two sides signed a nationwide ceasefire on October 23. The GNA and aligned groups maintained control of the Western Mountains and the northwest coastal areas stretching from the Tunisian border to Sirte. LNA-aligned groups controlled the remainder of Libya, including Cyrenaica, and the central and southern districts of Jufra, Kufra, Sabha, and Murzuq. Libya's vast, sparsely populated desert areas, particularly in central and southern Libya, remain safe havens for al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Libya (ISIL-Libya). The GNA, although the internationally recognized government, lacked the capacity and reach to exercise control in most of Libya and relied on militias and other armed groups for security in areas it did not have the ability to effectively control, including the capital Tripoli. The GNA had limited ability to eliminate terrorist safe havens, prevent the flow of FTFs, or ensure effective counter-proliferation efforts. Because of the difficulties of controlling the southern and desert borders and a lack of respect for security procedures at air and seaports of entry by foreign state or Libyan substate groups, the GNA remained unable to effectively track flows of FTFs in and out of its territory. During the year, significant numbers of foreign mercenaries deployed to the country, including Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups with ties to terrorist groups operating in Syria. Rival factions and political stakeholders outside of the GNA, including in the LNA-aligned forces, also were unable to stem the flow of FTFs."

However, owing to the ongoing conflict, the ROYG was severely constrained in its ability to prevent terrorist training, funding, recruitment, and transit. Although AQAP and ISIS-Yemen have been degraded in recent years, the two groups continued to benefit from the ongoing conflict with the Houthis, successfully instilling themselves among elements of the anti-Houthi coalition and exploiting the security vacuum in large parts of the country. Further, AQAP continued to harbor external operations ambitions.

In banning the group, German authorities noted that it features strong anti-Semitism and a militant aggressive general attitude.

Based in Geneva, Switzerland, GCERF focuses on preventing and countering terrorism by building the capacity of small, local, community-based organizations. GCERF has raised more than $100 million from 18 governments. As of June, there were 32 active grants in Bangladesh, Kenya, Kosovo, Mali, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Tunisia, and grant making will soon commence in Somalia and Sri Lanka. During 2020, GCERF grants directly empowered an estimated 1.7 million people at risk of terrorist recruitment and radicalization, and indirectly engaged a further estimated 7.8 million individuals. The proportion of girls and women reached has increased to almost 50 percent since 2016. Since 2014, 14 countries, plus the EU, have contributed more than $85 million to GCERF. In 2020, GCERF brought on two new donor countries."

By extending these connections beyond a country's national central bureau to strategic, high-volume airports, seaports, and land ports of entry, as well as other government agencies with investigative responsibilities, national authorities are better enabled to identify, deter, and interdict FTFs and other transnational criminals. Acknowledging the value of this initiative and the importance of addressing connectivity gaps in countries at risk of FTF travel, in 2016 the G-7 pledged to extending I-24/7 connectivity to 41 priority countries by the end of 2021. Since that time, the United States has engaged INTERPOL and the USNCB to help fulfill the G-7 commitment by providing funding for projects aimed at extending connectivity in 15 countries."

The United States is working with the EU to co-fund AU 1540 coordinators and likewise is in discussions with Northeast Asian partners to support an ASEAN 1540 coordinator position. U.S. funds also continued to be used to conduct projects that assist African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries in strengthening national 1540 implementation by developing voluntary national action plans (NAPs). Given the key role played by current 1540 coordinators in GoE-supported peer-to-peer reviews, the United States will continue to promote the idea of establishing additional 1540 regional coordinators, to increase the number and quality of NAPs in the lead-up to a UNSCR 1540 Comprehensive Review, which is currently expected to be held in 2021."

This action came in direct response to UNSCR 2396 of 2017, which requires states to develop the capability to collect, process, and analyze PNR data, in furtherance of ICAO SARPs. UNSCR 2396 also requires states to ensure PNR data are used by and shared with all their competent national authorities, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for the purpose of preventing, detecting, and investigating terrorist offenses and related travel. Finally, it urged ICAO to set standards for the collection, use, processing, and protection of PNR data. Secretary General Dr. Fang Liu supported the work to develop these standards by promoting awareness of states' obligations and the importance of ICAO responding expeditiously to help implement UNSCR 2396."

CVE requires a comprehensive rule-of-law-based and human-rights-respecting approach involving national and local governments, religious leaders, civil society, educators, women, youth, the private sector, and affected communities. In 2020, through bilateral and multilateral engagement, the Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT Bureau) emphasized four key areas in strategy formulation, diplomatic engagement, and foreign assistance programming: 1) countering all forms of terrorist ideologies, 2) countering use of the internet for terrorist purposes, 3) rehabilitation and reintegration, and 4) counter messaging. The CT Bureau partnered with government officials, community leaders, mental health professionals and social workers, religious figures, and others to build a prevention architecture to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment."

Saudi authorities worked closely with the United States to implement counterterrorism commitments and to develop capabilities to counter violent extremist messaging. Saudi officials remain eager to enhance defense and security cooperation and expand engagement with the United States, including on CVE issues. Regular high-level consultations and cooperation with the United States — including, notably, at the October U.S.-Saudi Strategic Dialogue — played a crucial role in the Saudi Arabian government's (SAG's) ability to address domestic and regional terrorism threats. Saudi Arabia maintained adequate legal frameworks, security forces, and institutional preparedness to combat \"extremist threats.\" Attacks by Iran and groups it sponsors or supports on Saudi Arabia and against international shipping targets along the Saudi coast increased the urgency of Saudi efforts to defend its territory against Iranian-backed terrorism. Saudi Arabia remained a regional leader in countering terrorist financing, hosting the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center that brings together the United States and Gulf partners to confront new and evolving networks and lead efforts on anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing measures."

Saudi Arabia's ideological approach to countering terrorist propaganda also included family outreach initiatives; integration of gender considerations in CVE work; and public messaging campaigns to amplify moderate voices in mainstream media, mosques, Islamic organizations, community centers, and prisons, to curb the appeal of \"radical ideology\" and to counter \"extremist messages.\" Security authorities continued to employ the Mohammed bin Naif Center for Care and Rehabilitation (the MbN Center) to deprogram, monitor, and rehabilitate former Saudi terrorists or foreign fighters."

During FY 2020, TTR completed pre-service piloting of this curriculum and, as a result, six preservice institutions incorporated USAID's model curriculum in their reading instruction. As TTR ended, USAID launched its new basic education activity, Okuu Keremet (Learning Is Awesome), to continue to improve early grade learning outcomes in reading and math. In FY 2020, Okuu Keremet completed the development of three advanced reading modules and five math modules for teacher training in English, Kyrgyz, and Russian. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, Okuu Keremet also prioritized the production of digital books that could be accessed online and over social media. More than 250 titles of books for grades 1-4 were produced online in Russian and Kyrgyz and illustrated by local authors."

The activity also developed grades 2, 3, and 6 reading and math assessment tools for the national literacy and numeracy baseline to be implemented in the next academic year. In addition, around 125 trainers, curriculum specialists, and teacher coaches received training on the pedagogical strategies needed to create an effective distance learning environment. In response to the COVID-19 situation, and to keep children engaged in learning at home while schools are still closed, the activity distributed educational boxes to 148,201 students in all of Lebanon's 887 primary public schools. More than 280 lessons in English, Arabic, French, and math have been developed and posted online for teachers and students to access. Meanwhile, through the Community Support Program, USAID completed vital equipment provision and rehabilitation to five public schools, benefiting more than 2,700 students once schools are in session and pandemic restrictions are lifted."

In FY 2020, 45,000 previously out-of-school children benefited from nonformal education in places where formal schools do not exist, or where schools are too crowded to accommodate the influx of children fleeing insurgency in Borno and Yobe States. When learning was disrupted by COVID-19, the Addressing Education in Northeast Nigeria (AENN) activity shifted to radio instruction, reaching 25,000 more listeners than the original target of those attending nonformal learning centers (NFLCs). For 11,550 children in insurgent-affected remote areas that are beyond the reach of radio signals, AENN provided home learning kits for children and their caregivers to continue learning and reinforcing basic concepts. Overall, the activity reached 55,040 male and 57,460 female students in FY 2020."

The Northern Education Initiative Plus activity produced and distributed 1.4 million textbooks and teachers' manuals to formal schools and NFLCs in 10 local government areas of each state. USAID also trained 50,000 out-of-school children and adolescent girls in 1,000 NFLCs before state-ordered closures caused by COVID-19. To that point, more than 672,223 children in formal schools were learning to read, 20 percent more than anticipated for this period. That accomplishment would have been impossible without the 10,730 teachers and learning facilitators whom USAID trained on best practices for reading instruction."

Finally, in FY 2020, USAID celebrated the successful conclusion of a partnership with Florida State University and Nigeria's Bayero University in Kano (BUK) to promote early grade reading research and practice. The activity led to the establishment of the Nigeria Center for Reading Research and Development at BUK, which in March hosted 900 participants at its second conference on early grade textbooks and children's literature."

USAID also distributed 21,147 TLMs and trained 447 community teachers over the life of the activity, including dedicated leadership training for 96 headteachers in FY 2020. USAID also equipped community education committees for the 21 predominantly pastoralist communities with materials and supplies to establish and operate mobile schools, using donkeys, and maintaining pastoral students' ability to learn while on the move. Based on third-party monitoring data that indicated overcrowded classrooms in specific centers, ABE created eight additional classrooms to accommodate the additional demand."

Following the 2012 coup that toppled the Malian government, AAD was among the organizations (which also included al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb [AQIM] and Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa) to take over northern Mali, destroy UNESCO World Heritage sites, and enforce a severe interpretation of Sharia law upon the civilian population living in the areas under its control."

NPA's founder, Jose Maria Sison, reportedly directs CPP/NPA activity from the Netherlands, where he lives in self-imposed exile. Luis Jalandoni, a fellow Central Committee member and director of the CPP's overt political wing, the National Democratic Front, also lives in the Netherlands. Although primarily a rural-based guerrilla group, the CPP/NPA has an active urban infrastructure to support its terrorist activities and, at times, has used city-based assassination squads."

The group generally follows the religious guidance of the Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Hizballah is closely allied with Iran, and the two often work together on shared initiatives, although Hizballah also occasionally acts independently. Hizballah shares a close relationship with the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad, and like Iran provides assistance — including fighters — to Syrian regime forces in the Syrian conflict."

The Assad regime in Syria has provided training, weapons, and diplomatic and political support.

These include smuggling contraband goods, passport falsification, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and credit card, immigration, and bank fraud."

In 2012 the PKK claimed responsibility for multiple car bombings that killed more than 10 people. Between 2012 and midyear 2015, the Turkish government and the PKK resumed peace negotiations, but the negotiations ultimately broke down — owing partly to domestic political pressures and the conflict in Syria."

LeT is led by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. Shortly after LeT's FTO designation, Saeed changed the group's name to Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JUD) and launched humanitarian projects to circumvent sanctions. LeT disseminates its message through JUD's media outlets. Since the creation of JUD, LeT has repeatedly changed its name in an effort to avoid sanctions."

Al-Murabitoun was originally part of al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) but became a separate organization in 2012 after its leader, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, split from AQIM. After the split, Belmokhtar threatened to fight against western interests and announced the creation of the al-Mulathamun Battalion. In 2013 the al-Mulathamun Battalion and the Mali-based Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (known as MUJAO) announced that the two organizations would merge under the name “al-Murabitoun.” In 2015, al-Murabitoun announced a re-merger with AQIM. In 2017 the Sahara Branch of al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Murabitoun, Ansar al-Dine, and the Macina Liberation Front came together to form Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)."

Established in 1988, the group helped finance, recruit, transport, and train fighters for the Afghan resistance against the former Soviet Union. AQ strives to eliminate western influence from the Muslim world, topple \"apostate\" governments of Muslim countries, and establish a pan-Islamic caliphate governed by its own interpretation of Sharia law that would ultimately be at the center of a new international order. These goals remain essentially unchanged since the group's 1996 public declaration of war against the United States. AQ leaders issued a statement in 1998 under the banner of \"The World Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders,\" saying it was the duty of all Muslims to kill U.S. citizens — civilian and military — and their allies everywhere. AQ merged with al-Jihad (Egyptian Islamic Jihad) in 2001. While numerous AQ leaders have been killed in recent years, including Usama bin Laden in 2011, AQ's current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large."

The group was formed in 1997 as the clandestine armed wing of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, a “political pressure group” dedicated to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and unifying Ireland. The RIRA has historically sought to disrupt the Northern Ireland peace process and did not participate in the 2005 weapons decommissioning. Despite internal rifts and calls by some jailed members (including the group’s founder Michael “Mickey” McKevitt) for a cease-fire and disbandment, the RIRA has pledged additional violence and continued to conduct attacks. Many RIRA members are former Provisional Irish Republican Army members who left the organization after the group renewed its cease-fire in 1997. These members brought extensive experience in terrorist tactics and bomb making to the group."

In the 1980s, SL was one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the Western Hemisphere. In 1992 the Peruvian government captured Guzmán who, along with key accomplices, is serving a life sentence in prison.
