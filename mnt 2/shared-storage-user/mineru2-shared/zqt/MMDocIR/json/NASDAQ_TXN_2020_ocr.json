The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, which includes investments in R&D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, we allocate to acquisitions for inorganic growth, which we last did in 2011 when we acquired National Semiconductor."

Finally, we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets. Generally, our products serve a large and diverse customer base, which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product, market or customer. In addition, they typically have long shelf lives and low risk of obsolescence. Industrial and automotive markets also benefit from long product life cycles, with revenue often lasting 10 years or more, which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality."

These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors."

We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals."

A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products.

Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding or distribution taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability.

The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility."

In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan's expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate."

Auditing management's estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management's estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings."

For example, this included controls over the Company's assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management's process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures performed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company's tax positions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the Company's accounting for its tax positions taking into consideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company's financial statement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters."

Rather, it uses its judgment to identify nominees whose backgrounds, attributes and experiences, taken as a whole, will contribute to the high standards of board service at the company. The board actively seeks women and minority candidates for the pool from which board candidates are chosen. Maintaining a balance of tenure among the directors is also part of the board's consideration. Longer-serving directors bring valuable experience with the company and familiarity with the strategic and operational challenges it has faced over the years, while newer directors bring fresh perspectives and ideas. To help maintain this balance, the company has a mandatory retirement policy, pursuant to which directors cannot stand for election after reaching age 70. The effectiveness of the board's approach to board composition decisions is evidenced by the directors' participation in the insightful and robust, yet respectful, deliberation that occurs at board and committee meetings, and in shaping the agendas for those meetings."

The review enabled the committee to see how various compensation elements relate to one another and what impact its decisions would have on the total earnings opportunity of the executives. In assessing the information, the committee did not target a specific level of total compensation or use a formula to allocate compensation among the various elements. Instead, it used its judgment in assessing whether the total was consistent with the objectives of the program. Based on this review, the committee determined that the level of compensation was appropriate."

In setting bonuses, the committee considered quantitative and qualitative measures on both an absolute and relative basis, and the company's strategic focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and made certain that resulting decisions were founded on both solid data and sound judgment. On an absolute basis, revenue and operating profit margin were both positive, with operating profit being better than median relative to competitors while revenue remained below median. TSR was also positive on an absolute basis and below median relative to competitors. Free cash flow for the year was \\(5.5 billion and \\(38\\%\\) of revenue. In aggregate, the committee determined that the company continued to strengthen its strategic position and operating performance, while also growing 2020 Analog revenue. Therefore, the committee targeted a bonus increase of 5 percent for 2020, except for two named executive officers who were newer to their roles and received higher bonus increases in an effort to more closely align their total cash with the competitive market for their roles and the company's performance. Details on the committee's assessment are below."

That obligation is not required of written consent solicitations, with the result that stockholders could be requested to take action without all necessary information and without appropriate time to deliberate. Written consent further disenfranchises stockholders by eliminating the requirement that all stockholders participate in key corporate decisions.

TI has a robust investor engagement program that allows stockholders to ask questions of and express their opinion to TI management and the board. Our investor relations team regularly engages with stockholders to answer questions and seek feedback regarding our business operations, both at investor events and meetings as well as through direct communication with our investor relations team. As part of TI's governance, compensation, environmental and social outreach program, members of TI management annually engage with top stockholders to listen to their views and get feedback on these programs. Given these robust engagement opportunities for stockholders, a written consent right is unnecessary."

For example, our two directors who received low stockholder support in 2019 due to stockholder concern about their other public company board commitments received more than \\(97\\%\\) in 2020. The increase in stockholder support is attributable to the directors' reducing their number of non-TI board commitments, despite the fact that those additional outside commitments were within the company's established guidelines."

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe free cash flow and these ratios based on it provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures and are reconciled in the table below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures."
