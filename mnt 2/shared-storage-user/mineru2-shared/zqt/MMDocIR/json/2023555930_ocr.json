                "content": "SUMMARY The Islamic Republic of Iran, as established following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, is an Islamic theocracy. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic recognizes Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, as well as Zoroastrianism, and encourages participation of their members in politics and society to the extent that this participation is not considered threatening to the Islamic Republic. The constitution and major laws emphasize the dominance of Islam and Muslims in all spheres of public life. Under Iranian law, converting from Islam is considered apostasy and can result in severe punishments, including the death penalty. Religious minorities possess certain codified rights, but the legislators have prohibited non-Muslims from being guardians of Muslim children, non-Muslim men from marrying Muslim women, and non-Muslims from inheriting from Muslims. Non-Muslims also do not receive the same forms of redress for certain harms as Muslims receive. Members of religious minorities cannot receive equal retribution for some crimes or take senior governmental, military, or high public managerial positions. Established rights of constitutionally recognized religious minorities are reserved and protected to a significantly higher degree than those of members of unrecognized minorities, which include those who convert from Islam or speak against the Islamic Republic's interpretations of Islam."

The provision does not specify religion as one of the prohibited bases for discrimination, and the phrase \"and the like\" has not been interpreted by Iranian jurists to include religion. While Iranian law regards constitutionally recognized non-Muslims as persons who are protected under international treaties that Iran has signed and ratified, and under other domestic laws2—mainly article 13 of the constitution—Islamic jurisprudence as interpreted by Iranian Islamic jurists considers non-Muslims, including constitutionally recognized non-Muslims, as unbelievers in Islam (kafir). Therefore, Iranian law, in numerous places, has considered what it has vaguely presumed as \"superiority\" in religious faith as a ground for validating important civil rights—for example, testimony3—and it has clearly and openly discriminated on the basis of religion in such matters as inheritance, financial retribution, and blood money (diya).

In contrast, Book V remained largely unaltered, retaining its original articles and numbering. This has resulted in varying practices in publishing the code, with some versions using Book V's original article numbers and others continuing the sequence from the current Book IV. In some cases, both numbers are presented, with the old number followed by the new number in parentheses. Consequently, Book V spans articles numbered 498 (729) to 785 (1008). For example, article 638 (864) in Book V bears both its original number 638 and the new number 864, following the sequence from the current Book IV in the 2013 code.

An example is the case of Yousef Nadarkhani, a pastor who faced the death penalty for converting from Islam to Christianity and for charges of evangelization. His sentence was later overturned. Expressing dissent against the Iranian regime's interpretation of Islam or opposing certain laws is an offense against Islam and the Islamic Republic. Dissenters are often charged with committing crimes against national security, insulting the supreme leader, and \"waging war against God\" (mohaarebeh). The regime exploits overly broad articles of the penal code, including those related to propaganda against the state and establishment of or membership in \"disruptive groups,\" to prosecute human rights and religious minority activists.[43]"
