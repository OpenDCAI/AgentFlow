S/GWI's focus areas include: 1) women's leadership and meaningful participation in peace and security; 2) advancing women's economic empowerment and environmental leadership; 3) preventing and responding to gender-based violence; and 4) and improving the effectiveness and leadership of U.S. foreign policy by integrating gender equity and equality. In all these areas, we place special emphasis on the areas of the world that both align with our foreign policy priorities and include the most vulnerable women and girls, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. S/GWI will also integrate the addition of a Special Envoy on Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights, and support staff, as the Department continues to focus on Afghanistan and promoting the rights and protection of Afghan women, girls, and human rights."

We use our program funding and gender training to catalyze gender work across the Department to foster public/private partnerships on gender equality and women's empowerment as well as create program models for gender integration and women's empowerment, which advance U.S. foreign policy goals and champion American values. We engage in sustained and comprehensive public outreach through our messaging and programs, including the annual Secretary's International Women of Courage Award (IWOC), and work towards enhancing the international policy and legal framework undergirding women's rights. We strengthen the capacity of our office personnel through robust and inclusive hiring, training, and management practices that value and leverage our diversity."

In societies impacted by insecurity or conflict, including those where newfound conflict may arise due to pressing global challenges such as climate change, a growing evidence base finds that women's participation in efforts to resolve conflict and rebuild increases the success of peace agreements, supports long-term recovery from conflict, and enables democratic systems of governance. In both conflict and non-conflict situations, protection from all forms of violence, abuse, and exploitation, including gender-based violence, is crucial to facilitating the meaningful participation of women and girls. This goal aligns with the NSS and the Joint Strategic Plan (JSP)."

An inclusive approach to WEE must include women and girls' meaningful participation and leadership in developing solutions to global and climate-related challenges, addressing workers' rights, advancing care infrastructure, improving access to financing and technology.

Addressing GBV requires a holistic, survivor-centered approach that prevents violence through changing cultural norms, provides timely response resources and services to help survivors recover and heal, and secures justice for survivors to live safe, empowered lives. Efforts to advance gender equity and equality through increasing women and girls' full participation in society, including access to comprehensive health care, educational and economic opportunities, and political and social life, mutually reinforce respect for human rights and may reduce risks"

Addressing GBV and other gender and human rights issues is a policy priority in its own right but is also central to important foreign policy priorities such as promoting democracy, establishing women's economic security, and enabling women's involvement in peace and security. S/GWI leads policy efforts to prevent and respond to GBV globally across multiple fora, including through multilateral platforms such as the Generation Equality Forum.

To maximize the effectiveness of our work, the United States must be able to respectfully and safely engage with the full diversity of members in a given community, country, and/or organization. By supporting gender integration and institutionalization across all lines of work, S/GWI advances efforts within the Department to ensure that U.S. foreign policy reaches and advocates for women and girls in all their diversity, in ways that are inclusive, comprehensive, and productive. This S/GWI goal is part of how the U.S. Government upholds democracy, human rights, and dignity. This goal aligns with the interim NSS; JSP goals 3 (Democracy, Values, and Human Rights), 4 (Revitalize Workforce), and 5 (Serve, Exchange, and Connect); and the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality (NGS)."

S/GWI will mitigate these risks by becoming more familiar with civil service hiring processes, outreach to diverse communities while also applying a range of hiring processes that meet the timing and staffing needs of the office, regular consultations with HR and CDIO on best practices, and leveraging the bureau's operations budget to hire contractors, as appropriate."

Risks include: availability of training, limited financial resources, excessive workload, staff capacity and will, championship from and prioritization by leadership, and under-utilized insights.
