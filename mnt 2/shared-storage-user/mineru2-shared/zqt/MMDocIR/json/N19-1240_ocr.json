These systems, given a text and a question, need to answer the query relying on the given document.

The last generation of large-scale reading comprehension datasets, such as a NarrativeQA (Kocisky et al., 2018), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and RACE (Lai et al., 2017), have been created in such a way as to address this shortcoming and to ensure that systems"

Note that MATCH edges when connecting mentions in the same document are mostly included in the set of edges predicted by the coreference system. Having the two types of edges lets us distinguish between less reliable edges provided by the coreference system and more reliable (but also more sparse) edges given by the exact-match heuristic. We treat these three types of connections as three different types of relations. See Figure 2 for an illustration. In addition to that, and to prevent having disconnected graphs, we add a fourth type of relation (COMPLEMENT edge) between any two nodes that are not connected with any of the other relations. We can think of these edges as those in the complement set of the entity graph with respect to a fully connected graph."

Secondly, we notice that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. Though it may be surprising for coreference edges, recall that the MATCH heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases, and for the rest the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable. Still, modelling all these different relations together gives our Entity-GCN a clear advantage. This is our best system evaluating on the development. Since Entity-GCN seems to gain little advantage using the coreference system, we report test results both with and without using it. Surprisingly, with coreference, we observe performance degradation on the test set. It is likely that the test documents are harder for the coreference system.[5]"

The first two mainly focus on single document QA and Welbl et al. (2018) adapted both of them to work with WIKIHOP. They process each instance of the dataset by concatenating all \\( d \\in S_q \\) in a random order adding document separator tokens. They trained using the first answer mention in the concatenated document and evaluating exact match at test time. CorefGRU, similarly to us, encodes relations between entity mentions in the document. Instead of using graph neural network layers, as we do, they augment RNNs with jump links corresponding to pairs of corefereed mentions. MHPGM uses a multi-attention mechanism in combination with external commonsense relations to perform multiple hops of reasoning. Weaver is a deep co-encoding model that uses several alternating biLSTMs to process the concatenated documents and the query."
