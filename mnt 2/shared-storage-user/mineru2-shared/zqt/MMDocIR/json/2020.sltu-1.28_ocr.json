Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark."

Until recently these applications were created for high-resourced languages which analysed monolingual utterances. But social media in multilingual communities contains more code-mixed text (Barman et al., 2014; Chanda et al., 2016; Pratapa et al., 2018a; Winata et al., 2019a). Our study focuses on sentiment analysis in Tamil, which has little annotated data for code-mixed scenarios (Phani et al., 2016; Jose et al., 2020). Features based on the lexical properties such as a dictionary of words and parts of speech tagging have less performance compared to the supervised learning (Kannan et al., 2016) approaches using annotated data. However, an annotated corpus developed for monolingual data cannot deal with code-mixed usage and therefore it fails to yield good results (AlGhamdi et al., 2016; Aguilar et al., 2018) due to mixture of languages at different levels of linguistic analysis."

It is largely observed in educated speakers although not completely absent amongst less educated and uneducated speakers (Krishnasamy, 2015). Due to their pervasiveness of English online, code-mixed Tamil-English (Tanglish) sentences are often typed in Roman script (Suryawanshi et al., 2020a; Suryawanshi et al., 2020b)."

We used the YouTube Comment Scaper tool and collected 184,573 sentences for Tamil from YouTube comments. We collected the comments from the trailers of a movies released in 2019. Many of the them contained sentences that were either entirely written in English or code-mixed Tamil-English or fully written in Tamil. So we filtered out a non-code-mixed corpus based on language identification at comment level using the langdetect library. Thus if the comment is written fully in Tamil or English, we discarded that comment since monolingual resources are available for these languages. We also identified if the sentences were written in other languages such as Hindi, Malayalam, Urdu, Telugu, and Kannada. We preprocessed the comments by removing the emoticons and applying a sentence length filter. We want to create a code-mixed corpus of reasonable size with sentences that have fairly defined sentiments which will be useful for future research. Thus our filter removed sentences with less than five words and more than 15 words after cleaning the data. In the end we got 15,744 Tanglish sentences."

The machine learning models were applied to this subset of data rather than k-fold cross validation. The only other code-mixed dataset of reasonable size that we could find was an earlier work by Remmiya Devi et al. (2016) on code-mix entity extraction for Hindi-English and Tamil-English tweets, released as a part of the shared task in FIRE 2016. The dataset consisted of 3,200 Tanglish tweets used for training and 1,376 tweets for testing."

In a multi-class classification setup, micro-average is preferable if there are class imbalances. For instance in our data, we have many more examples of positive classes than other classes. A macro-average will compute the metrics (precision, recall, F-score) independently for each class and then take the average. Thus this metric treats all classes equally and it does not take imbalance into account. A weighted average takes the metrics from each class just like macro but the contribution of each class to the average is weighted by the number of examples available for it. For our test, positive is 2,075, negative is 424, neutral is 173, mixed feelings are 377, and non-Tamil is 100."

Surprisingly, the classification result by the SVM model has much worse diversity than the other methods. Applying deep learning methods also does not lead to higher scores on the three automatic metrics. We think this stems from the characteristics of the dataset. The classification scores for different sentiment classes appear to be in line with the distribution of sentiments in the dataset."

The precision, recall and F-measure scores are higher for the Positive class while the scores for Neutral and Mixed feeling classes were disastrous. Apart from their low distribution in the dataset, these two classes are difficult to annotate for even human annotators as discussed in Section 4. In comparison, the Negative and Other language classes were better. We suspect this is due to more explicit clues for negative and non-Tamil words and due to relatively higher distribution of negative comments in the data."
