Such an alternative means exist here: candidates for non-statewide office may qualify without paying the fee if they submit a pauper’s affidavit and satisfy a \\(1\\%\\) signature requirement. O.C.G.A. § 21-2-132(g)-(h). And this Circuit has upheld higher fees than Georgia’s \\(3\\%\\) fee. See Green, 155 F.3d at 1339 (7.5% and \\(6\\%\\) fees); Little v. Florida Dep’t of State, 19 F.3d 4, 5 (11th Cir. 1994) (4.5% fee). The Libertarian Party presents no evidence that the amount of the fee has precluded prospective candidates from accessing the ballot; to the contrary, it stipulated that several candidates who did not successfully amass the required petition signatures did pay the qualifying fee."

The “alternative way” around qualifying by nomination petition is available to Libertarian candidates for statewide office, but not non-statewide office. Under Supreme Court precedent, that is a cognizable “geographic classification.” Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 183–87 (1979). So as the Libertarian Party proposes, and because the start of the 180-day petitioning window is nearly upon us, we will conduct the necessary equal protection analysis ourselves based on the summary judgment record instead of remanding a second time to the district court. See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (stating that we may “affirm the district court’s judgment on any ground that appears in the record”)."

The magnitude of this inequality, however, is (at most) only as substantial as the severity of the burden of meeting the \\(5\\%\\) signature requirement—the hurdle non-statewide candidates must overcome. And as we have already concluded, that burden is not severe. The disparity between candidates can thus be justified if the State puts forward an important regulatory interest. See id. at 1281."
