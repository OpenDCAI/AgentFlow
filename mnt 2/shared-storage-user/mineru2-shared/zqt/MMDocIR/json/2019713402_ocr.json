The process for these visas involves the submission of an expression of interest (EOI), which includes completion of the relevant points test, and the issuance of an invitation to apply for the visa. Where state or territory nomination is required for a visa, a relevant government agency selects EOIs from the pool based on its own criteria. The points test for three of the above visas is largely the same, with additional points added for required state or territory nominations or family sponsorship, and the \"pool\" and \"pass\" marks for the test are established by a legislative instrument. The \"Business Innovation and Investment\" visa is subject to a different points test under the relevant regulations."

The Express Entry application management system is governed under Ministerial Instructions. The system manages applications for permanent residence through a two-step process: First, the system assesses whether the applicant is eligible for any of the three programs and those that are placed in the Express Entry pool are assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on the information in their profile by looking at factors such as education, language ability, and work experience. Invitations for permanent residence are sent to the candidates with the highest scores in the pool. The points an applicant gets from the CRS have two components—a core set of points up to 600 based on factors such as skills and experience and a set of additional points up to 600 based on factors such as a valid job offer—with a total score out of 1,200 points. The CRS score is dynamic depending upon updates to the profile."

For the Skilled Migrant Category, EOIs are entered into a pool only if a certain minimum number of points are claimed, and will only be selected from the pool if they meet a higher minimum. For the Investor 2 Category, EOIs that meet the set requirements are entered into the pool and ranked according to the number of points claimed.

This sponsorship requirement aims to make the employer responsible for the migrant worker and includes notification requirements if the employee stops working. Dependents may apply to enter the UK under the majority of subcategories within the tiers, and there is a maintenance requirement that must be demonstrated for most dependent applicants."

This requirement may be waived if the sponsor provides the applicant with a certificate of sponsorship stating that they will provide each dependent with £630 to enable them to cover their costs for a month should they require it.
