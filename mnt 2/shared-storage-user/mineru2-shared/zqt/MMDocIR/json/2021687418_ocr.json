The Court has set out a two-part test to determine whether legislation imposes an unconstitutional burden on this freedom. The second part of the test, which involves considering whether the burden imposed on the freedom is \"reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end\" in a manner consistent with the maintenance of representative and responsible government, has resulted in diverging approaches among the High Court justices. One approach involves the application of a structured proportionality analytical framework, using a \"compatibility test\" to evaluate whether the purpose of the law and the means it adopts are \"legitimate.\" An alternative view is that the standard of review should vary depending on the nature and extent of the burden, with laws that do not pose a significant risk to representative government needing only to be \"rationally related\" to the pursuit of a legitimate end. The law is unsettled and is likely to be discussed further in future cases."

The former are held by Australian citizens and are not constitutionally entrenched, while the latter restrict the exercise of legislative and executive power. Although Australian cases have recognized a common law right to free speech,<sup>1</sup> political speech only receives constitutional protection through the operation of the freedom of political communication."

As demonstrated below, speech only receives constitutional protection to the extent it is protected by the implied freedom of political communication."

Rather than considering what was required by the implication of representative government, Justice McHugh looked at sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution, which establish elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, and argued that these provisions require that \"the people have a constitutional right to convey and receive opinions, arguments and information concerning matter intended or likely to affect voting in an election for the Senate or the House of Representatives.\" There is a subtle difference between this approach and the approach favored by Chief Justice Mason and Justice Gaudron in ACTV. Their Honors each found that the Constitution entrenched representative and responsible government, which in turn gave rise to the freedom of political communication. See ACTV v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 138-140 (Mason CJ), 211-12 (Gaudron J). See also the judgment of Justices Deane and Toohey in Nationwide News v Willis (1992) 177 CLR 1, 72.
