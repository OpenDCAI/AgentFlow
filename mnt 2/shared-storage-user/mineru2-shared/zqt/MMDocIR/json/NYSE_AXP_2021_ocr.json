These product refreshes have yielded strong results, with acquisitions for both these card products reaching all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our value propositions have resonated particularly well among younger customers, with Millennial and Gen Z customers representing about 60 percent of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2021."

We also enhanced and expanded our financial relief programs to assist our customers who faced financial hardships. As the pandemic continued, we made the decision to increase investments to drive customer acquisition, engagement and retention. These initiatives have driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than pre-pandemic levels. During 2021, we relaunched our consumer Platinum Card and Business Platinum Card in the United States and introduced our first business checking account product and new digital capabilities, in part resulting from the Kabbage technology platform we acquired in 2020."

Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiate American Express cards."

As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, we must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be \"well capitalized\" and \"well managed,\" and AENB must have received at least a \"satisfactory\" rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly)."

In May 2020, the OCC issued a final rule intended to (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; and (iii) change the methods for CRA measurement, data collection, recordkeeping and reporting for national banks and federal savings associations. Effective January 1, 2022, that final rule was rescinded and replaced with a rule based on the rules adopted jointly by the federal banking agencies in 1995, as amended. This action was intended to promote consistency for all insured depository institutions while the agencies continue their ongoing work to modernize the CRA framework on an interagency basis."

For example, on October 21, 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) issued its Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, which contains 35 recommendations for FSOC's member agencies and serves as a framework for next steps. In addition, on December 16, 2021, the OCC issued for public comment a set of proposed \"Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.\" The principles would apply to OCC-regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, like AENB, and are broadly designed to provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks consistent with existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles outline six key aspects of climate-related financial risk management: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. In addition, the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climate-related financial risks in various traditional risk categories. It is too early to determine what regulations and policies may be adopted or apply to the Company and AENB and the effect of any such regulations or policies on the Company and AENB."

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time. In Europe, AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia, have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express."

The federal banking regulators' guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies."

During 2020, we pre-purchased a significant amount of loyalty points from certain of our travel cobrand partners, which we have used and intend to continue to use for promotions, rewards and incentive programs for our customers. To the extent such partners cease operations or the loyalty points are no longer desired by our customers, the value of any pre-purchased points we still have at that time may be diminished and may result in an impairment charge. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or \"flown.\" If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. At December 31, 2021, our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchases that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $24.5 billion. This amount assumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such purchases or to accept such chargebacks, and that all such billed business results in claims-in-full by Card Members. Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions, particularly to travel, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures and staff shortages. See Note 12 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information regarding this exposure."

Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including nondiscrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours."

This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture."

Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the UK. In a ruling issued on February 7, 2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. As a result, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU or the UK."

We expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. For example, as previously disclosed, beginning in May 2020, we began responding to a regulatory review led by the OCC and the Department of Justice Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales. We also conducted an internal review of certain sales from 2015 and 2016 and have taken appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions, including voluntarily providing remediation to certain current and former customers. Information regarding our investigation has been provided to our other regulators, including the Federal Reserve. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information on sales practices related to consumers. We are cooperating with all of these inquiries into our sales practices and related compliance practices and continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations."

During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT was reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT's acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights remain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG). Upon consummation of the business combination, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by APSG's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals, the terms of certain of our commercial arrangements with GBT will be amended and GBT will become a public company."

A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent, would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates."

Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend.

The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company's reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company's models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions."

The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability.

The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs."

As a result, we believe PAM is preferable as it better reflects the economics of our tax credit investments. Since the impact of this change is immaterial to our prior and current year financial statements, we implemented PAM on a prospective basis which resulted in a one-time charge to Income tax provision of $55 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the cumulative impact of the difference in the timing of expense recognition between the equity method and PAM."

The methodology for estimating credit losses for available for sale debt securities requires us to estimate lifetime credit losses for all available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. When estimating a security's probability of default and the recovery rate, we assess the security's credit indicators, including credit ratings. If our assessment indicates that an estimated credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the estimated credit loss through the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other loans Provision for credit losses. Unrealized gains and any portion of a security's unrealized loss attributable to non-credit losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of tax. We had accrued interest on our available-for-sale debt securities totaling $12 million and $26 million, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, presented as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets."

We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management's best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns."

In September 2021, the tribunal rendered a further partial award regarding the location of transactions through non-physical channels.

The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities."

In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization."
