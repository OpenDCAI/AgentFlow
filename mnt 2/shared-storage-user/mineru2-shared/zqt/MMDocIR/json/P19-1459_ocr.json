This analysis informs the construction of an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy. Our adversarial dataset provides a more robust assessment of argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work."

Knowing (3) facilitates drawing the inferential connection between (1) and (2). However it would be hard to find it stated anywhere since warrants are most often left implicit (Walton, 2005).

Analysis of easy to classify data points showed reliance on a lower proportion of the strongest cue word than the BoV and BiLSTM - i.e. BERT has learned when to ignore the presence of \"not\" and focus on different cues. This indicates an ability to exploit much more subtle joint distributional information. As our learners get stronger, controlling for spurious statistics becomes more important in order to have confidence in their apparent performance. Taken with a growing body of previous work, our results indicate the need for further research into the extent of this problem in NLP more generally."
