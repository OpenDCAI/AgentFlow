Our analyses show that four popular industrial MT systems and two recent state-of-the-art academic MT models are significantly prone to gender-biased translation errors for all tested target languages.

Rudinger et al. (2018) and Zhao et al.

For instance, when translating our running example in Figure 1 to Spanish, a valid translation may be: “La doctora le pidio a la infermera que le ayudara con el procedimiento,” which indicates that the doctor is a woman, by using a feminine suffix inflection (“doctora”) and the feminine definite gendered article (“la”).

Second, similar to any medium size test set, it is clear that WinoMT serves only as a proxy estimation for the phenomenon of gender bias, and would probably be easy to overfit. A larger annotated corpus can perhaps provide a better signal for training. Finally, even though in Section 3.3 we show a very rudimentary debiasing scheme which relies on oracle coreference system, it is clear that this is not applicable in a real-world scenario. While recent research has shown that getting rid of such biases may prove to be very challenging (Elazar and Goldberg, 2018; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), we hope that this work will serve as a first step for developing more gender-balanced MT models."
