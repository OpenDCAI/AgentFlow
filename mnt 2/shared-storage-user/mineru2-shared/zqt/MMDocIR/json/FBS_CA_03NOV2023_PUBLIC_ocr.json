Establishing sound and effective U.S. border security begins with the issuance of secure error-free passports to U.S. citizens and visas to foreign nationals who qualify for them, and denial of these travel documents to those who do not. Facilitation of legitimate travel has a tangible impact on the U.S. domestic economy and U.S. business interests.

Consular personnel assist U.S. citizens affected by crises, including but not limited to, natural disasters, political strife, and medical emergencies. We work diligently to prevent and resolve international parental child abduction and improve intercountry adoption throughout the world. Advances in technology have created both new opportunities for, and challenges to, the way CA interacts with U.S. citizens. Through the span of this FBS, CA will continue to improve access to safety and security information and develop more efficient ways to quickly disseminate information to reach effectively those traveling and residing abroad."

Consular officers at U.S. Embassies and Consulates provide visa services to millions of applicants and relatives of U.S. citizens seeking to immigrate to the United States. Improving capabilities to provide visa services in a secure, accurate, and efficient manner results in increased legitimate travel while securing borders in support of national security. Issuing visas and facilitating travel to the United States for immigration, temporary work, and tourism are crucial to continued U.S. economic recovery and to President Biden's promise of a foreign policy for the middle class. CA relies on internal and interagency information technology to screen visa applicants effectively. Partner agencies provide data, analysis, and experience with which CA can continue to improve processes. Foreign governments share critical security information. As immigration trends and global threats evolve, CA will continue its collaboration with the interagency community and foreign partners. Efforts to improve visa processing will provide better services to visa applicants and U.S. citizens while increasing the integrity of the process."
