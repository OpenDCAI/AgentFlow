Research on automated fact-checking has proposed methods based on supervised learning, but these approaches do not consider external evidence apart from labeled training instances. Recent approaches counter this deficit by considering external sources related to a claim. However, these methods require substantial feature modeling and rich lexicons. This paper overcomes these limitations of prior work with an end-to-end model for evidence-aware credibility assessment of arbitrary textual claims, without any human intervention. It presents a neural network model that judiciously aggregates signals from external evidence articles, the language of these articles and the trustworthiness of their sources. It also derives informative features for generating user-comprehensible explanations that makes the neural network predictions transparent to the end-user. Experiments with four datasets and ablation studies show the strength of our method."

The media landscape is becoming a twilight zone and battleground. This societal challenge has led to the rise of fact-checking and debunking websites, such as Snopes.com and PolitiFact.com, where people research claims, manually assess their credibility, and present their verdict along with evidence (e.g., background articles, quotations, etc.). However, this manual verification is time-consuming. To keep up with the scale and speed at which misinformation spreads, we need tools to automate this debunking process."

However, they use only the text of questionable claims and no external evidence or interactions that provide limited context for credibility analysis. These approaches also do not offer any explanation of their verdicts. On the other hand, Popat et al. (2017) considers external evidence in the form of other articles (retrieved from the Web) that confirm or refute a claim, and jointly assesses the language style (using subjectivity lexicons), the trustworthiness of the sources, and the credibility of the claim. This is achieved via a pipeline of supervised classifiers. On the upside, this method generates user-interpretable explanations by pointing to informative snippets of evidence articles. On the downside, it requires substantial feature modeling and rich lexicons to detect bias and subjectivity in the language style."

However, our method does not require any feature engineering, lexicons, or other manual intervention. Rashkin et al. (2017); Wang (2017) also develop an end-to-end model, but DeClarE goes far beyond in terms of considering external evidence and joint interactions between several factors, and also in its ability to generate user-interpretable explanations in addition to highly accurate assessments. For example, given the natural-language input claim “the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together” by Hillary Clinton, DeClarE draws on evidence from the Web to arrive at its verdict credible, and returns annotated snippets like the one in Table 6 as explanation. These snippets, which contain evidence in the form of statistics and assertions, are automatically extracted from web articles from sources of varying credibility."

The objective of this task is to predict the credibility of a questionable tweet (true, false or unverified) along with a confidence score from the model. It has two sub-tasks: (i) a closed variant in which models only consider the questionable tweet, and (ii) an open variant in which models consider both the questionable tweet and additional context consisting of snapshots of relevant sources retrieved immediately before the rumor was reported, a snapshot of an associated Wikipedia article, news articles from digital news outlets, and preceding tweets about the same event. Testing and development datasets provided by organizers have 28 tweets (1021 reply tweets) and 25 tweets (256 reply tweets), respectively."

The remaining model parameters are tuned on the validation data; the parameters chosen are reported in Table 2. We use Keras with a Tensorflow backend to implement our system.

On the other hand, for the Snopes dataset, performance of DeClarE (Full) is slightly lower than the Distant Supervision configuration (p-value of 0.04 with a pairwise t-test). However, the advantage of DeClarE over Distant Supervision approach is that it does not rely on hand crafted features and lexicons, and can generalize well to arbitrary domains without requiring any seed vocabulary. It is also to be noted that both of these approaches use external evidence in the form of reporting articles discussing the claim, which are not available to the LSTM-text and CNN-text baselines. This demonstrates the value of external evidence for credibility assessment."
