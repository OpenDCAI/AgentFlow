Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. In spite of such substantial investment, there can be no guarantee that our research and development activities will produce commercially successful new products that will enable us to replace revenue and income lost to competition and to grow our business.

Further, regulatory authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous and time-consuming requirements for approval and reimbursement of new products and new indications. Similarly, the post-approval regulatory burden has also increased. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals for our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, change to product specifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability. The clinical testing, regulatory processes and post-approval activities described above become more difficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primarily due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials. In addition, travel restrictions resulting from pandemics make it more difficult for regulatory authorities to inspect sites.

Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data privacy, Current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, and animal welfare. Should we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative financial consequences as a result of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that investments in research and development activities could have no benefit to the Group. Research to find new targets for drug discovery and the therapeutic agents to treat unmet medical needs is made more difficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primarily due to safety-related restrictions on the ability of laboratory scientists to work in research laboratories, and impacts our ability to collaborate with academic and commercial research organizations facing similar challenges and restrictions."

The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors, including, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or difficulty of manufacturing a competitor product and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single competitor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceutical products in such geographies; and our ability to successfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also offset the income lost to generic or biosimilar competition.

Historically, while there are highly overlapping data strategy and architectural needs across our business units, we have taken the approach of building distinct solutions across both business units and geographies, which may cause disruptions to our operational stability. We are currently in the design and planning phase for the implementation of a new global ERP system that seeks to simplify, standardize and digitize processes in our commercial and finance functions and our Novartis Technical Operations unit to help ensure efficient and compliant business operations across business units and geographies as well as the availability of high-quality data necessary to aid our decision-making. We expect the first implementation of our new ERP system to begin in the second half of 2023, with full implementation by 2028, when our current system is out of maintenance by the software provider. Implementing and operating a new ERP system involves certain risks, including a failure of the new system to operate as expected, a failure to properly integrate with other systems we use, potential loss of data or information, compliance issues, cost overruns and delays, and operational disruptions. Any disruptions or malfunctions of our new ERP system could cause critical information we use to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. In addition, if the design or implementation of our new ERP system is deficient, it could adversely affect our operations, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of our internal controls."

Falsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of adverse events related to falsified medicines and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system affect patient confidence in our genuine medicines and in healthcare systems in general. These events could also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from the falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to the genuine one. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines, which are then not properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Further, there is a direct financial loss when, for example, falsified medicines replace sales of genuine medicines, or genuine medicines are recalled following discovery of falsified products."

Sudden increases in economic, currency or financial market volatility in different countries have also impacted, and may continue to unpredictably impact, our business or results of operations, including the conversion of our operating results into our reporting currency, the US dollar, as well as the value of our investments in our pension plans."

Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in different countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially different from the amounts accrued."

This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are still under discussion. The OECD expects that the implementation of these new principles will begin globally in 2023. The EU also adopted a new Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6) in 2018, which seeks additional reporting as of July 2020. During 2021, all EU member states implemented this EU directive as part of their respective local laws and regulations. In 2020, the EU announced it will introduce new centralized taxation powers to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not yet occurred. In addition, the European Commission continues to extend the application of its policies seeking to limit fiscal aid by member states to particular companies, and the related investigation of the member states' practices regarding the"

For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately \\(17\\%\\), \\(11\\%\\) and \\(6\\%\\), respectively, of net sales in 2021. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to \\(16\\%\\), \\(12\\%\\) and \\(7\\%\\), respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2021. The trend has been toward further consolidation among distributors and retailers. As a result, we may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. Furthermore, these customers are gaining additional purchasing leverage, increasing the pricing pressures facing our businesses. These pressures can particularly impact our Sandoz Division, the generic products of which can often be obtained from numerous competitors. Moreover, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result of this concentration among our customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial difficulties, the effect on us would be substantial, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to us."

We divide the development process into two stages: Exploratory Development to establish proof of concept, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Exploratory Development consists of clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) studies, which are small clinical trials (typically involving between five and 15 patients) that combine elements of traditional Phase I/II testing. NIBR conducts these customized trials, which are designed to give early insights into issues such as safety, efficacy and toxicity for a drug in a given indication. Once a positive proof of concept has been established, the drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of GDD. Confirmatory Development has elements of traditional Phase II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and efficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall benefit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Exploratory and Confirmatory Development may be combined and suffice for registration under certain conditions such as high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval."

If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The sponsor must then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure."

This legislation did not pass before the end of the 2021 calendar year. However, Democrats said they plan to revisit it in early 2022 and would like to pass drug pricing reform legislation before campaigning for the November mid-term elections begins. Further, by December 31, 2021, 20 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring manufacturer price transparency reporting, with eight of these states also allowing for drug affordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The disclosure requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. It is expected in 2022 that state legislatures will continue to focus on drug pricing and that similar bills will be passed in more states."

In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict cost-benefit assessments. In addition, prices for marketed products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individual EU member state pricing. Member states also collaborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU countries have passed legislation to impose further mandatory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or financial claw-backs on the pharmaceutical industry.

In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to customers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada – which has relatively stringent price controls – are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Such imports from Canada and other countries into the US are currently illegal. However, given the increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in the US, the Biden administration, certain members of the US Congress, and several US states continued to explore regulatory and legislative ways to allow the safe importation of pharmaceutical products into the US from select countries, including Canada. Six US states have enacted drug importation laws, but the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must certify that each state's importation plan is safe and cost-effective before it can be implemented."

The RDP period can vary depending upon the type of data included in the sponsor's application. When it is available, market exclusivity, unlike RDP, may preclude a competitor from obtaining marketing approval for a product even if a competitor's application relies on its own data. RDP and market exclusivity periods generally run from the date a product is approved, and so their expiration dates cannot be known with certainty until the product approval date is known and exclusivity has been granted by the relevant authorities."

An SPC may be granted to provide, in combination with the patent, up to 15 years of exclusivity from the date of the first European marketing authorization. However, an SPC cannot last longer than five years. The SPC duration may be extended by a further six months if the product is the subject of an agreed pediatric investigation plan. The post-grant phase of patents, including the SPC system, is currently administered on a country-by-country basis under national laws that, while differing, are intended to (but do not always) have the same effect."

The discovery of nitrosamines in some types of drug products led several health regulators (e.g., EMA, FDA and others) to conduct a detailed analysis of these impurities in affected medicinal products. Novartis works with health authorities around the world to continuously review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines. The EMA, FDA and other health authorities have provided guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamines in medicines. The EMA review concluded in March 2021 for chemical human medicines and in July 2021 for biological human medicines. Any products identified with a potential risk for nitrosamines will undergo further testing. For these products, the final outcome of this testing and potentially necessary control strategies will be submitted to the EMA and other health authorities by September 2022."

Increasing pressure on healthcare expenditure and numerous patent and data exclusivity period expirations have encouraged more generic product launches, resulting in increased competition among the companies selling generic pharmaceutical products, leading to ongoing price pressure. In particular, Sandoz faces increased industrywide pressure on prices for generic products, particularly in the US, driven by factors including customer consolidation and growing competition from other manufacturers of generic medicines. These factors contributed to a decline in industrywide US sales that began in 2017 and continued through 2021."

While generic pharmaceuticals normally do not require clinical studies in patients, regulators worldwide do require such targeted studies for biosimilar products. Biosimilars are engineered to match the reference medicine in quality, safety and efficacy. This is achieved by systematically defining the target range of the reference medicine and then comparing the biosimilar to the reference medicine at various development stages to confirm biosimilarity and to establish that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar and the reference biologic. Because the purpose of a biosimilar clinical development program is to confirm biosimilarity and not to establish efficacy and safety de novo, the clinical studies required are less than those required for a reference biologic. Therefore, the cost of development for a biosimilar is usually less than that of a reference biologic."

An ANDA is generally permitted to be filed four years after the initial approval of the reference product and generally cannot be fully approved by the FDA until any regulatory exclusivity of the reference product has expired. The process typically takes nearly two years from the filing of the ANDA until FDA approval. However, delays can occur if issues arise, for example, regarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study data, labeling requirements for the generic product, or qualifying the supply of active ingredients. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires a generic manufacturer to certify in certain situations that the generic product does not infringe on any current applicable patents on the product held by the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference product, or to certify that such patents are invalid. This certification often results in a patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the generics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the Hatch-Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month delay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to resolve the intellectual property issues. For generic applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing a certification claiming non-infringement or patent invalidity, the Hatch-Waxman Act generally provides those applicants with 180 days of marketing exclusivity, enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market their product alongside the reference product at a certain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual property issues have been resolved. However, after such point in time, the generic applicants must launch their products within certain time frames or risk losing the marketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a first-to-file applicant."

We seek to expand access to our medicines to patients in both developed and developing countries, while addressing major global health challenges. We reached 56.2 million patients in 2021 through access initiatives, and we have set ambitious targets to reinforce our commitments to access and global health. We focus our global health efforts on the control or elimination of four priority diseases: (i) sickle cell disease, (ii) Chagas disease, (iii) malaria and (iv) leprosy."

To reinforce our commitment to these targets, we issued a EUR 1.85 billion sustainability-linked bond (SLB) in 2020. The bond is the first of its kind in the healthcare industry and the first SLB incorporating social targets, with bondholders entitled to receive a higher amount of interest if Novartis fails to meet its access targets. Our stakeholders expect us to follow high ethical standards wherever we operate: We are making progress in embedding our Code of Ethics across the organization and supporting employees to do what is right when faced with ethical dilemmas. We are also committed to being a responsible corporate citizen by reducing the environmental footprint of our Company. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025 and carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. We also aim to be water and plastic neutral by 2030."

The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines and the American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway recommend Entresto as first-line heart failure therapy. In China, Entresto has been listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for both HFrEF and hypertension, effective January 2022."

Leqvio is administered by a healthcare professional twice a year as an injection, following an initial dose and a dose at three months. On December 22, 2021, it was approved in the US to treat adults with clinical ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. In the EU and other countries, it is approved to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia. It is used in combination with a statin or a statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL cholesterol goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated."

Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at their fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment and, if material, are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time."

Overall, while the financial and operational targets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation targets were missed, which led to a reduction in long-term growth potential. This is reflected in a TSR performance below the peer group median. The reduced contribution of innovation and relative TSR to the 2019-2021 LTPP cycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized compensation in 2021 versus 2020.

Major approvals included Leqvio (US, EU), Scemblix (US), and Kesimpta (EU). Amongst our critical clinical trials, Cosentyx met primary efficacy endpoint in two hidradenitis suppurativa Phase III studies, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to LU-PSMA based on Phase III studies that demonstrated significant positive results in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \nThirty-four submissions were made across our top four markets: the US, the EU, China and Japan. We advanced our diverse pipeline of investigational therapies, with 20 clinical data readouts and seven transitions into our Global Drug Development (GDD) organization. In our early-stage development activities, we secured 12 proofs of concept (POCs)/ proofs of mechanism (POMs). We continued to invest in technology platforms with the initiation of Phase III trials for Zolgensma for older children and advancing two rapid CAR-Ts into pivotal trials following positive POC results. We also continued to expand our portfolio of radio-ligand therapies and siRNA therapeutics. \nThe year was however not without setbacks, as several clinical trials of experimental compounds did not meet their primary goals, including Kymriah for second line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), canakinumab for lung cancer, iscalimab in kidney transplant patients, and the program on ECF843 for treatment of dry eye. \nThe biosimilars pipeline was expanded with one late-stage alliance program and early-stage internal programs, strengthening our 15-plus molecule pipeline. \nThe pipeline was further advanced through partnerships with BeiGene, Alnylam, Molecular Partners and UCB; bolt-on acquisitions such as Gyroscope Therapeutics and Arctos Medical; and the out-licensing of products outside of our core areas.</td><td>Below</td></tr><tr><td>Operational excellence (20%) \nFinancial performance in 2021 improved from last year on core operating income and core margin, to USD 16.0 billion and 32.0% in constant currencies respectively. Net income exceeded target. The gain from the divestment of the investment in Roche Holding AG was not considered in any of the performance assessments. The financial performance was largely driven by growth brands Cosentyx and Entresto, which together generated USD 8.3 billion in sales as well as other growth drivers like Zolgensma, Promacta/Revolade, Kisqali, and Kesimpta. However, the effects of the pandemic were still apparent in Oncology and Sandoz as we continued to see delays in cancer care and a weak flu season dampened generics sales. \nKey launches were successfully executed in 2021 with Entresto (US; to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) and Kesimpta (EU, Japan) achieving their sales goals. \nWe continue to optimize our network of manufacturing sites and testing labs worldwide, adjusting our production capacity to match our changing product mix. Overall, our year-end footprint was consolidated to 53 sites, with a number of other site exits planned.</td><td>Above</td></tr><tr><td>Data and digital (20%) \nUsing data science and digital technology, we opened new paths to treat disease, engage with customers, support patients and streamline our operations. Our industry-leading data42 platform continued to expand, integrating additional external data sets and making data from more than 2700 clinical trials, as well as data from real-world settings, available to data scientists and researchers across Novartis. \nIn partnership with Microsoft, we rolled out a new artificial intelligence platform that connects data sets and leverages information from past formulations which was used by our development team for formulation development and early manufacturing of investigational medicines. Usage of AI Nurse, our cardiovascular disease app developed in collaboration with Tencent, grew to more than 300000 patients and more than 5000 healthcare professionals across 1000 hospitals in China using it. \nSpotOn, a platform in our manufacturing operations, was expanded to five sites providing multiple digital solutions to help maximize economy of scale, reduce throughput times, and optimize inventories.</td><td>Met</td></tr></table>"

The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the Withholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a tax credit.

In April 2020, the ACC decided to invite several audit firms, including PwC, to participate in a tender process that would lead to the selection of an external auditor to be proposed for election at the 2022 AGM. The audit tender was conducted through a fair, transparent and balanced process according to defined selection criteria under a strong governance structure, ensuring that all audit firms had equal access to management and information. Based on the results of this tendering process, the Board decided to propose to the shareholders at the 2022 AGM the election of KPMG AG (\"KPMG\") as the external auditor commencing for the 2022 fiscal year. As disclosed in our Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we notified PwC that they would not be proposed for re-election as external auditor at the AGM on March 4, 2022. If KPMG is elected as our new external auditor at the 2022 AGM, KPMG would then serve as our external auditor for the 2022 fiscal year."

As a result, at the end of the vesting period, the charge during the entire vesting period represents the amount that will finally vest. The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date."

This amended standard has been applied to transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2020. The amended standard allows an entity to apply an optional concentration test, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to evaluate whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If this optional concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business. The adoption of this amended standard on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods. However, this will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions and if the Group decides to apply the optional concentration test in the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is or is not a business."

In 2020, Sandoz Inc. reached a resolution with the DOJ Antitrust Division, pursuant to which Sandoz Inc. paid USD 195 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. The Sandoz Inc. resolution related to instances of misconduct at the company between 2013 and 2015 with regard to certain generic drugs sold in the United States. Under the terms of that agreement, Sandoz Inc. will continue to take steps to enhance its compliance program, employee training and monitoring, and will continue to cooperate with the US government's ongoing investigation into the generic pharmaceutical industry. Sandoz Inc. also finalized a resolution with the DOJ Civil Division and in 2021 paid USD 185 million plus interest from the date of the agreement in principle, to settle related claims arising under the FCA, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This resolution with the DOJ resolves all federal government matters related to price fixing allegations."

The litigation includes complaints alleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as complaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry conspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penalties under federal and state antitrust and consumer protection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC) for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims are being vigorously contested."

None of these claims have been asserted in legal proceedings and no further letters have been sent since. Novartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA's decision. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in Italy and France. Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various countries, including Italy and Turkey."

Novartis disputed Amgen's allegations vigorously. In 2020, the court ruled that Amgen did not have grounds to terminate the 2017 agreement and dismissed that portion of their lawsuit. In 2022, the parties reached a confidential agreement to settle all remaining claims in the litigation. Novartis returned its Aimovig US rights to Amgen, which is now exclusively commercializing Aimovig in the US. Novartis will continue to commercialize Aimovig in the rest of the world, with the exception of Japan. This matter is now concluded."

Responding to such investigations is costly and requires an increasing amount of management's time and attention. In addition, such investigations may affect our reputation, create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have contributed to decisions by Novartis and other companies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settlements have involved and may in the future involve large cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our affiliate Novartis Corporation is a party to such an agreement, which will expire in 2025. Also, matters underlying governmental investigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation."
