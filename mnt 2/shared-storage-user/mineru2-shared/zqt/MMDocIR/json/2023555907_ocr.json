For the most part, unaccompanied minors are defined as asylum seekers under the age of 18 who are not accompanied by an adult when entering the state's territory. Some countries, such as Canada and Brazil, have definitions in policy or in guidance documents. Others, such as Chile, draw on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, with elaborations through jurisprudence. In the EU, the definition is codified in the directly applicable Dublin III Regulation and the EU Qualification Directive, which must be implemented into the law of the member states. National legislation defining unaccompanied minors in the EU member states Greece, Germany, Italy, and France, draws on the EU definition. In Israel, procedures from the Population and Immigration Authority form the definition. Malta provides a definition in legislation, which is further defined in regulation. The UK sets out its rules in regulation. Russia, on the other hand, does not distinguish between minor and adult asylum seekers. Some countries, such as Italy, make distinctions between minors over 14 years of age and those younger than 14 years of age."

In Canada, the United States is designated as a safe third country, and asylum seekers crossing the land border from the United States are generally inadmissible for refugee status in Canada, with exceptions, including unaccompanied minors. In the EU, the Dublin III Regulation provides that the member state where the minor has family present is responsible for providing asylum to the child. Germany, Malta, and the UK have safe country of origin policies, where asylum requests from certain countries are presumed to be without merit. Finland does not maintain a safe country list, but assumes that all EU member states are safe countries. In all EU states, the law provides that asylum seekers can only make an asylum claim in one EU country. It also deems Turkey to be a safe third country. Israel makes it a criminal offense to cross outside of an official border crossing, precluding an asylum claim. Greece and Turkey, however, provide minors with an exemption from the expedited removal procedure, without exempting them from the overall inadmissibility policy. In Russia, minors can be returned to their country of origin if they are from member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States."

Minors have the right to seek and receive asylum following international treaties currently in force in Chile. In the EU, unaccompanied minors are entitled to a legal representative, with fees paid for by the state. In Greece, unaccompanied minors who are victims of human trafficking activity and who are cooperating with the authorities for the prosecution of this activity may be given visas on a discretionary basis. In Finland, a legal representative is appointed by the district court, but the relationship is severed once the minor turns 18 years of age. In France, minors are generally exempt from removal proceedings. In Israel, minors must be interviewed in a way that is sensitive to the potential trauma they may have experienced. Israel also distinguishes between asylum seekers eligible for citizenship under the Law of Return and those who are ineligible, with some exceptions for Ukrainian citizens. Russia does not provide for the appointment of a legal representative, nor are children eligible for any specific visa programs."

EU law requires that children not be housed in prison facilities or co-mingled with adult detainees. Furthermore, detention must be as short as possible and only used as a last resort. Brazil bans the collective detention of classes of migrants and will not repatriate minors, a policy also implemented in France. In Germany, minors and families with minors should only be detained in exceptional circumstances and without endangering the well-being of the child. Greece similarly severely limits the detention of minors, restricting it to less than 25 days. Israel allows detention for up to 60 days with an extension permissible if release would harm public health or the security of the state. Italy places children in foster families as an alternative to detention. In Malta, unaccompanied minors are not to be held in detention, although, in practice, many are held under the authority of health regulations. In Finland, minors over the age of 15 can be detained, and the state also provides financial assistance to a minor who wishes to return to their country of origin. In the UK, minors can only be held in immigration detention facilities for a maximum of 24 hours. In Canada, minors can only be held in immigration detention as a last resort and must attend school if required by provincial law for persons of their age."

According to EU law, once their application has been approved, asylum seekers must be granted access to employment, education, procedures for recognition of qualifications, social welfare, healthcare, and accommodation under the same conditions as nationals. Some states in Germany have established special education programs geared toward migrant communities to aid in their integration. In Greece, some migrants are resettled elsewhere in Europe under an EU resettlement program. In France, the law and jurisprudence grant unaccompanied minors access to the same programs and services as French citizens. Malta recently launched an integration program that leads to the issuance of a certificate after 230 hours of instruction. Turkey provides child asylum seekers with basic educational programming, but does not envisage the permanent settlement of refugees on its territory, instead working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) toward the resettlement of asylum seekers. In the UK, local authorities continue to have a duty to support the integration of asylum seekers between 18 and 21 years of age. Canada restricts the resettlement of unaccompanied minors to those who apply in-country rather than from abroad through the UNHCR, unless they have family already present in Canada."

Family reunification must be requested within three months of arrival and is restricted to first-degree relatives in an ascending line unless there are no such relatives available. In Germany, parents of unaccompanied minors who have been granted certain residence titles must be issued a temporary residence permit to move to that country. Greece restricts family reunification to legal residents and refugee status holders. In France, unmarried children may generally request to be joined by their parents and their minor unmarried siblings who are still dependent on the parents. UK law places a duty on the government to trace the family of the unaccompanied minor with the best interests of the child as a primary, but not sole, priority, but suggests that reunification does not necessarily have to occur in the UK. In Canada, minors cannot apply for family reunification, but the minor's parents can apply to the minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds."

It states that, as an exception, in the case of unaccompanied minors, the Member State responsible is the one where a family member or a sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, or in the absence of a family member or sibling, where a relative, meaning an aunt, uncle, or grandparent, is legally present. If they are present in more than one Member State, the best interests of the child must be the guiding principle in making a decision.[21] In the absence of a family member, a sibling, or a relative, the Member State responsible is the one where the unaccompanied minor has lodged an asylum application.[22]"

The Asylum Seeker Benefits Act provides that people with special needs, such as unaccompanied minors, are eligible to receive appropriate health care and related care, and the Eighth Book of the German Social Security Code contains a specific chapter on unaccompanied minors."

The Greek international protection legislation provides procedural protections to unaccompanied minors by adopting the best interest of the minor as a general principle in making decisions, and under certain circumstances exempting unaccompanied minors from disadvantageous fast-track procedures for the examination of asylum applications. The law establishes a centralized database of qualified legal entities that act as \"guardianship service providers,\" from which guardians are appointed to unaccompanied minors. The law designates the Special Secretariat for the Protection of Unaccompanied Minors under the Ministry of Migration and Asylum as the competent body responsible for administering the rules regarding the accommodation and care of unaccompanied minors, in cooperation with the minor's appointed guardian and other immigration and social services authorities. While guardianship service providers remain the legal guardian of the unaccompanied minor, the law provides for various options for the physical custody and daily care of the minor, including placement with a foster family, accommodation in a full-service long-term accommodation center, or accommodation in semi-independent living facilities for older minors. General rules regarding repatriation are applicable to unaccompanied minors if and when their asylum applications are denied, or their status terminated. Unaccompanied minors have been resettled in other European countries through a voluntary resettlement program funded by the European Union."

Italy is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. Recent legislation on MSNA from 2017 overhauled the legal regime applying to MSNA. The core rule is that MSNA may never be rejected at the border, and refoulement and expulsion are prohibited. Once a MSNA is found in the Italian territory, they must be provided with a full array of health and social services and assistance aimed at their identification, determination of age, and wellbeing. The paramount rule is that all decisions must be made based on the best interest of the child. Once MSNA have been provided with basic services, the legislation grants them a roster of legal and social benefits first and foremost, and a residence permit allows them to pursue educational and social integration opportunities. Repatriation of MSNA is allowed under strict criteria and conditions, and family reunification is broadly permitted pursuant to European Union and domestic Italian legislation."

There is no publicly available and reliable data regarding the number of unaccompanied minors among this current child population, or the number of refugees or asylum seekers who were unaccompanied minors when they were first processed by immigration authorities. Turkish asylum law provides for certain procedural and welfare measures protecting unaccompanied foreign minors who enter the country, and mandates that all administrative processes involving these persons must be conducted in light of the best interest of the child. Unaccompanied foreign minors must be handed over to the care of the Ministry of Family and Social Services after their initial registration is done by immigration authorities. The Ministry is responsible for placing the child with responsible relatives, a foster family, or in an appropriate public childcare institution. Special protections afforded to unaccompanied minors in the asylum application process include requiring specially qualified personnel to be present during any interview with the minor, and a categorical exemption from administrative immigration detention. There are no special or accelerated procedures for obtaining asylum or a visa for unaccompanied foreign minors, however, special procedures are provided for family tracking and reunification. General provisions regarding repatriation and voluntary return apply to unaccompanied minors, but subject to the requirement that all administrative and judicial processes take into account the best interest of the child."

After a positive status determination is made (or temporary protection is granted), the PMM remains the administrative agency responsible for all transactions and processes related to the continuation and termination of the asylum status of the UFM, the UFM's removal, voluntary return or final resettlement in a third country, and for coordinating with the Ministry of Family and Social Services and other related agencies in the provision of public services such as education and health services."

Instead, you will be detained and promptly removed either to your home country or to a safe country where any asylum claim will be considered.\"[74] Under the current provisions of the bill, individuals entering the UK without lawful permission will be detained and removed to their home country, or if it is not safe for them to be removed there, to a safe third country, such as Rwanda,[75] and applications for asylum will be considered from these countries.[76]"
