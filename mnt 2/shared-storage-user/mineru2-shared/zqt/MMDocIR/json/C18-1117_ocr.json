In this paper, we survey the current state of academic research related to diachronic word embeddings and semantic shifts detection. We start with discussing the notion of semantic shifts, and then continue with an overview of the existing methods for tracing such time-related shifts with word embedding models. We propose several axes along which these methods can be compared, and outline the main challenges before this emerging subfield of NLP, as well as prospects and possible applications."

There are dozens of papers on the topic, mostly published after 2011 (we survey them in Section 3 and further below). However, this emerging field is highly heterogeneous. There are at least three different research communities interested in it: natural language processing (and computational linguistics), information retrieval (and computer science in general), and political science. This is reflected in the terminology, which is far from being standardized. One can find mentions of 'temporal embeddings,' 'diachronic embeddings,' 'dynamic embeddings,' etc., depending on the background of a particular research group. The present survey paper attempts to describe this diversity, introduce some axes of comparison and outline main challenges which the practitioners face. Figure 1 shows the timeline of events that influenced the research in this area: in the following sections we cover them in detail."

For instance, laws of phonological change have been formulated (e.g., Grimm's law or the great vowel shift) to account for changes in the linguistic sound system. When it comes to lexical semantics, linguists have studied the evolution of word meaning over time, describing so-called lexical semantic shifts or semantic change, which Bloomfield (1933) defines as “innovations which change the lexical meaning rather than the grammatical function of a form.”"

The categorization found in Bloomfield (1933) is arguably the most used and has inspired a number of more recent studies (Blank and Koch, 1999; Geeraerts, 1997; Traugott and Dasher, 2001). Bloomfield (1933) originally proposed nine classes of semantic shifts, six of which are complimentary pairs along a dimension. For instance, the pair 'narrowing' – 'broadening' describes the observation that word meaning often changes to become either more specific or more general, e.g. Old English mete 'food' becomes English meat 'edible flesh,' or that the more general English word dog is derived from Middle English dogge which described a dog of a particular breed. Bloomfield (1933) also describes change along the spectrum from positive to negative, describing the speaker's attitude as one of either degeneration or elevation, e.g. from Old English cniht 'boy, servant' to the more elevated knight."

Linguistic processes that cause semantic shifts generally involve the interaction between words of the vocabulary and their meanings. This may be illustrated by the process of ellipsis, whereby the meaning of one word is transferred to a word with which it frequently co-occurs, or by the need for discrimination of synonyms caused by lexical borrowings from other languages. Semantic shifts may be also be caused by changes in the attitudes of speakers or in the general environment of the speakers. Thus, semantic shifts are naturally separated into two important classes: linguistic drifts (slow and regular changes in core meaning of words) and cultural shifts (culturally determined changes in associations of a given word). Researchers studying semantic shifts from a computational point of view have shown the existence of this division empirically (Hamilton et al., 2016c). In the traditional classification of Stern (1931), the semantic shift category of substitution describes a change that has a non-linguistic cause, namely that of technologi-"

A key assumption in much of this work is that changes in a word's collocational patterns reflect changes in word meaning (Hilpert, 2008), thus providing a usage-based account of semantics (Gries, 1999). For instance, Kerremans et al. (2010) study the very recent neologism detweet, showing the development of two separate usages/meanings for this word ('to delete from twitter,' vs 'to avoid tweeting') based on large amounts of web-crawled data. The usage-based view of lexical semantics aligns well with the assumptions underlying the distributional semantic approach (Firth, 1957) often employed in NLP. Here, the time spans studied are often considerably shorter (decades, rather than centuries) and we find that these distributional methods seem well suited for monitoring the gradual process of meaning change. Gulordava and Baroni (2011), for instance, showed that distributional models capture cultural shifts, like the word sleep acquiring more negative connotations related to sleep disorders, when comparing its 1960s contexts to its 1990s contexts."

A similar problem was offered as SemEval-2015 Task 7: 'Diachronic Text Evaluation' (Popescu and Strapparava, 2015). Another possible evaluation method is so-called cross-time alignment, where a system has to find equivalents for certain words in different time periods (for example, 'Obama' in 2015 corresponds to 'Trump' in 2017). There exist several datasets containing such temporal equivalents for English (Yao et al., 2018). Yet another evaluation strategy is to use the detected diachronic semantic shifts to trace or predict real-world events like armed conflicts (Kutuzov et al., 2017b). Unfortunately, all these evaluation methods still require the existence of large manually annotated semantic shift datasets. The work to properly create and curate such datasets is in its infancy."

Thus, if one were able to more directly model word meaning, such an approach should be superior to frequency-proxied methods. A number of recent publications have showed that distributional word representations (Turney et al., 2010; Baroni et al., 2014) provide an efficient way to solve these tasks. They represent meaning with sparse or dense (embedding) vectors, produced from word co-occurrence counts. Although conceptually the source of the data for these models is still word frequencies, they 'compress' this information into continuous lexical representations which are both efficient and convenient to work with. Indeed, Kulkarni et al. (2015) explicitly demonstrated that distributional models outperform the frequency-based methods in detecting semantic shifts. They managed to trace semantic shifts more precisely and with greater explanatory power. One of the examples from their work is the semantic evolution of the word gay: through time, its nearest semantic neighbors changed, manifesting the gradual move away from the sense of 'cheerful' to the sense of 'homosexual.'"

It paved the way for quantitatively comparing not only words with regard to their meaning, but also different stages in the development of word meaning over time."

The weights corresponded to the number of shared most salient syntactic dependency contexts, where saliency was determined by co-occurrence counts scaled by Mutual Information (MI).

In Wijaya and Yeniterzi (2011), it helped solve a typical digital humanities task of finding traces of real-world events in the texts. Heyer et al. (2016) employed topic analysis to trace the so-called 'context volatility' of words. In the political science, topic models are also sometimes used as proxies to social trends developing over time: for example, Mueller and Rauh (2017) employed LDA to predict timing of civil wars and armed conflicts. Frermann and Lapata (2016) drew on these ideas to trace diachronic word senses development. But most scholars nowadays seem to prefer parametric distributional models, particularly prediction-based embedding algorithms like SGNS, CBOw or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014). Following their widespread adoption in NLP in general, they have become the dominant representations for the analysis of diachronic semantic shifts as well."

The reason is that most modern word embedding algorithms are inherently stochastic and the resulting embedding sets are invariant under rotation. Thus, even when trained on the same data, separate learning runs will produce entirely different numerical vectors (though with roughly the same pairwise similarities between vectors for particular words). This is expressed even stronger for models trained on different corpora. It means that even if word meaning is completely stable, the direct cosine similarity between its vectors from different time periods can still be quite low, simply because the random initializations of the two models were different. To alleviate this, Kulkarni et al. (2015) suggested that before calculating similarities, one should first align the models to fit them in one vector space, using linear transformations preserving general vector space structure. After that, cosine similarities across models become meaningful and can be used as indicators of semantic shifts. They also proposed constructing the time series of a word embedding over time, which allows for the detection of 'bursts' in its meaning with the Mean Shift model (Taylor, 2000). Notably, almost simultaneously the idea of aligning diachronic word embedding models using a distance-preserving projection technique was proposed by Zhang et al. (2015). Later, Zhang et al. (2016) expanded on this by adding the so called 'local anchors': that is, they used both linear projections for the whole models and small sets of nearest neighbors for mapping the query words to their correct temporal counterparts."

This can be considered as an alternative to model alignment: instead of aligning models trained from scratch on different time periods, one starts with training a model on the diachronically first period, and then updates this same model with the data from the successive time periods, saving its state each time. Thus, all the models are inherently related to each other, which, again, makes it possible to directly calculate cosine similarities between the same word in different time period models, or at least makes the models more comparable."

The former take into account the whole model (for example, 'second-order embeddings,' when we compare the word's similarities to all other words in the lexicon), while the latter focus on the word's immediate neighborhood (for example, when comparing the lists of \\( k \\) nearest neighbors). They concluded that global measures are sensitive to regular processes of linguistic shifts, while local measures are better suited to detect slight cultural shifts in word meaning.

For control experiments, they constructed two additional data sets; one with chronologically shuffled data where each bin contains data from all decades evenly distributed, and one synchronous variant containing repeated random samples from the year 1999 alone.

This has been held up as a good use case of deep learning for research in computational linguistics (Manning, 2015), and there are opportunities for future work applying diachronic word embeddings not only in the field of historical linguistics, but also in related areas like sociolinguistics and digital humanities."
