(Ret.) Tim Ziemer, the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator, President's Malaria Initiative, visited the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), November 29, for a brief on the current malaria vaccine research efforts and to tour the facility. He was interested in learning more about the malaria program at the laboratory. Capt. John Sanders, NMRC commanding officer, provided a general overview of the NMRC enterprise with emphasis on the infectious diseases research efforts, specifically in the area of malaria. "The NMRC malaria research program is at the forefront of malaria research worldwide," Sanders pointed out and added, "Researchers here have been investigating methods to control and conquer malaria for more than two decades and have made some exciting discoveries in the last few years." Ziemer visited a laboratory focused on investigating the liver stage of infection as a vaccine target, spoke with a researcher about antigen discovery and another researcher on the humanized mouse model developed at NMRC. He also had the opportunity to visit the insectary and hear about clinical immunology and current malaria (Continued on page 14)</Paragraph><Image image_id="1" page_num="1.0"><Alt_Text>A natural photograph depicting an indoor scene within a laboratory setting.

This past August the Navy Surgeon General entered an agreement with the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) that established NSMRL as CSF's primary human technology laboratory, including all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and performance. NSMRL is tasked to conduct medical, psychological and human performance research; provide independent, objective reviews of human systems related projects and technology proposed for CSF use; and develop new and innovative concepts for CSF that use human technology. Working directly with Vice Adm. Connor (CSF), NSMRL is aligned with the submarine force strategic direction. NSMRL also conducts investigations in diving medicine. This year NSMRL saw the addition of an external hatch on the Genesis hyperbaric chamber. This addition allows the chamber to draw a vacuum and be "flown" at pressures representative of those encountered at high altitudes. Unique features of this chamber include the abl- ity to lock-in and lock-out at depth or altitude, allowing for prolonged (months) studies. It also has the ability to study mission profiles that transition from depth to altitude and vice versa (picture a Special Operations Forces mission locking out of submarine and then scaling a mountain) without requiring any configuration changes. Recently NSMRL acquired NAVSEA's new DP1/2 diving system. The DP1/2 is a surface supplied air system that includes communications capability with the diver. This provides enhanced capabilities for underwater investigations, since the diver can receive directions and report back in real time to the topside personnel orchestrating the experimentation. In return, NSMRL is testing the equipment for general Navy diving use and validating/revising operating instructions for clarity, proper sequencing and procedural accuracy. NSMRL has a history of research in underwater communications, and with the acquisition of this diving system, we harnessed another improved means of communications with our divers. Hopefully this gave you a peek into the operational research world of NSMRL! NSMRL Commanding Officer sends, Steven M.

But along with games, food and general chit-chat, many service members were rubbing the inside of their cheek with a cotton swab. Marine Corps Base (MCB) Hawaii was participating in a basewide drive to register service members with the C.W. Bill Young Department of Defense Marrow Donor Program. Because 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines is scheduled to deploy, a drive was held during their family day.

According to the program website, the information will be entered into the National Marrow Donor Program registry. If there is a match between someone in the registry and a patient who needs marrow, that person will, with their consent, undergo additional blood and health testing to further confirm a definite match and then determine whether that person is able to donate.

Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program, joining more than 730,000 DoD volunteers who are potential marrow donors. Of these, over 5,200 have donated marrow for patients needing transplants to treat one of over 80 potentially fatal diseases. Following DoD donor drives like the one at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay, donor consent forms and oral swabs with cell samples are sent to the C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program Donor Center and Laboratory, which is part of the Naval Medical Research Center's (NMRC) Bone Marrow Research Directorate. The C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program is operated by the Navy and Georgetown University. Staff members at the laboratory perform genetic testing using the cells from the oral swabs to match potential donors with patients. Each swab is treated to isolate pure DNA from the genes on chromosomes from the cheek cells. The precise human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type (sequence of A, T, G or C DNA molecules) of each gene must be matched between potential donor and patient. Within families, each sibling has a 25 percent chance of being HLA identical to a second sibling. But 70 percent of patients needing transplants do not have a match in their family and rely on finding a match from among 10,000,000 volunteers listed on the National Marrow Donor Program registry. Because of the incredible diversity of HLA types in America, many more donors are needed. There are thousands of HLA types from each of the four HLA genes that are matched for transplantation and millions of potential combinations of the eight types for each person, one set of four HLA genes from each parent. If the donor who matches a patient is registered in the C. W. Bill Young DoD Program, a program representative tive contacts the potential donor and works closely with both the donor and the command. If the donor is available and agrees to proceed, additional genetic matching is performed to ensure a match. Additional medical evaluations are performed to ensure the donor's good health and a transplant date is selected. The donor's cells are transported to the patient's hospital for transplantation. The patient and donor can choose to meet each other one year after the transplant. The NMRC Bone Marrow Research Directorate provides military contingency support for causalities with marrow toxic injury due to radiation or chemical warfare agents. Exposure to radiation or chemical agents can cause unrecoverable damage to bone marrow, breaking down the immune system in the process. The directorate performs laboratory research that supports technology innovations to make highly reliable and cost-effective DNA -based typing for marrow transplants.</Paragraph><Paragraph page_num="5.0">5</Paragraph></Section><Section section_id="1.2.7" start_page_num="6.0" end_page_num="6.0"><Heading>Policy and Strategy with an Influenza/Infectious Disease Twist</Heading><Paragraph page_num="6.0">By NAMRU-2 Public Affairs</Paragraph><Image image_id="8" page_num="6.0"><Alt_Text>A circular emblem featuring a gold rope border surrounding a dark blue outer ring with the text "U.S. NAVAL MEDICAL RESEARCH UNIT-2" in white capital letters along the upper curve and "PACIFIC" in white capital letters along the lower curve.

Harrison is currently assigned to NAMRU-2 Pacific as a microbiologist, but at the encouragement of NAMRU-2 Pacific's leadership he has been attending a year-long series of working group sessions at USPACOM Headquarters, Camp Smith, Hawaii. "At first it was very intimidating being in the room with people who do policy for a living. I'm much more comfortable with the operational side of things," said Harrison. "It was very interesting to see the dynamics and work that goes into plans and policy development. It was very educational for a JO [junior officer] like me to be a part of." The JPG was chaired by US-PACOM's Functional Plans Branch Chief Lt. Col. Andrew Hocking, Australian Defense Force, and consisted of members from multiple codes at USPACOM and all over the island of Oahu, including Air Force Pacific, U.S. Army Pacific, Joint Task-Force Homeland Defense, Marine Forces Pacific, Department of State, the State of Hawaii, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Navy and Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit 6, among others. The purpose of the working group was to update and formulate the CONPLAN to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate a pandemic outbreak of influenza or other infectious disease of operational significance and, when required, respond to Defense Support of Civilian Authorities and Foreign Humanitarian Assistance requests. Over the past year, the JPG met to conduct a series of Mission Analysis and Course of Action development meetings culminating in a two-day war game aimed at testing the CONPLAN and to identify strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement before the plan is briefed to the USPACOM Commander.</Paragraph></Section><Section section_id="1.2.8" start_page_num="6.0" end_page_num="7.0"><Heading>LAVA Dogs Sign Up with DoD Bone Marrow Program Registry</Heading><Paragraph page_num="6.0">(Continued from page 5) families in need," said Chief Petty Officer Arvin Salas, a hospital corpsman with 21st Dental Company.

Since 2010, Navy biomedical researchers have been collaborating with the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) on two research projects funded by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center/Global Emerging Infections System (AFHSC-GEIS). These projects focus on disease vector surveillance, detection of vector-borne viral pathogens such as malaria, and vector control. The projects are enabling the country to independently expand vectorborne disease surveillance and detection capabilities in Liberia to benefit the Liberian Armed Forces as well as the entire population of Liberia. "Our projects in Liberia directly support our warfighters," said Capt. Buhari Oyofo, NAMRU-3 commanding officer. "We also need to leave the knowledge and tools behind so they can continue to support themselves once we're done." The NAMRU-3 team visited Monrovia, Liberia in November to meet with key collaborators, including Dr. Walter Gwenigale, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare; Dr. Fatorma Bolay, the Director of LIBR; and U.S. Marine Col. Vernon Graham, the officer in charge of Operation Onward Liberty (OOL). The Minister of Health and Social Welfare gave high praise for NAMRU-3's capacity building engagements in Liberia. He expressed specific thanks for the collaboration at LIBR, where he also serves as the chairman of the Board of Governors, and he expressed the hope that the current col</Paragraph><Image image_id="10" page_num="7.0"><Alt_Text>Five individuals are standing side-by-side on a raised tiled platform beneath a covered outdoor structure with a light brown wooden ceiling and white support pillars.

In a separate meeting, the Director of LIBR said, "The collaboration with NAMRU-3 is helping to restore many of the capabilities that LIBR had before the war." During a meeting with Graham, he expressed particular interest in the project combining insecticide spraying for all base housing with surveillance and geospatial mapping to determine the distribution of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. No malaria infections have been diagnosed in U.S troops since the onset of the spraying, which is carried out by NAMRU-3 in collaboration with the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE). This illustrates the risk reduction made possible with a force health protection policy employing both environmental vector controls and anti-malarial prophylaxis. With the assistance of OOL, NAMRU-3 has pursued military-to-military engagements with the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) through vector control training efforts in collaboration with LIBR. On a tour of Camp Edward Binyah, Oyofo met with Pfc. Nadoris Nador and Pfc. Henry Morris, two AFL Preventive Medicine Technicians. They told Oyofo how they had benefited from the training offered through NAMRU-3 AFHSC-GEIS projects.

In October, the tool was presented to the Force Health Protection and Readiness, Strategic Analysis Working Group Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs as part of the verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) plan for service acceptance. The working group forwarded their recommendation for accreditation to the Force Health Protection Integration Council. Once accredited, NHRC's PCOF tool will be approved as the Joint patient occurrence generating application. The PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk. PCOF tables exist within casualty categories of wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease and outpatient visits for a given combat or noncombat scenario throughout the range of military operations (ROMO). ROMO is defined for this effort to include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities and various combat operations. The military medical planning community, until now, lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in health care simulations. Using an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baseline, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission.

This memorandum's objectives directed Federal agencies to “[1] establish goals and measure performance, [2] streamline administrative processes, and [3] facilitate local and regional partnerships in order to accelerate technology transfer and support private sector commercialization.” 'Technology transfer and commercialization' is a phrase used by the business side of research and development that manages the wide range of discoveries, inventions and other intellectual property within the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) enterprise. The goal is bringing these discoveries to market for the benefit of the warfighter. The NMRC enterprise excels in facilitating local and regional partnerships due to the inventiveness and creativity of our research scientists and physicians. Most valuable biomedical developments begin in a laboratory, but the value to the warfighter requires moving that discovery through all the business steps, ultimately to manufacturing and distribution. This requires the establishment of appropriate technology transfer agreements. NMRC's technology transfer collaborations leverage research capabilities found in the public and private sectors to stretch research dollars and accomplish the mission of supporting the health and readiness of the military's men and women in uniform. For example, instead of a company having to reinvent something that is already available in a Navy laboratory, or vice versa, a partnership can capitalize on each collaborator's expertise toward achieving a shared goal. Every time an invention from one of our laboratories is commercialized into an accessible product, the U.S. taxpayer sees a tangible return on their investment and the Department of Defense has a product that will enhance the readiness of military personnel. Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) are key business vehicles among Navy biomedical scientists. This past quarter, the NMRC enterprise executed just over twenty CRADAs and reviewed an additional fourteen CRADAs for the Naval hospitals in Portsmouth and San Diego. One notable collaboration is being spearheaded by Cmdr. Jonathan Forsberg (NMRC, Operational and Undersea Medicine Directorate), who is working with a company to explore a novel mode of anchoring prosthetics. This project could produce important results for amputees. Another collaboration being led by Lt. Roxanne Burrus (U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6, Lima, Peru) involves Duke University and focuses on evaluating the effects of changing demography and land use on malaria transmission. This is an important issue in light of the prevalence of malaria in developing countries and is important to the health of deployed warfighters. An additional malaria-focused collaboration is being headed by Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi (NMRC, Infectious Diseases Directorate), who is using mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Lastly, Dr Bjorn Song (Naval Medical Research Unit-San Antonio) is leading a collaboration focused on exploring the use of a synthetic oxygen-carrying fluid to reduce tissue damage occurring in response to hemorrhagic shock. All of these collaborations have significant relevance to the military, but there is also considerable potential for these new sources of information and technologies to benefit the general population. Through the appropriate leveraging of resources through CRADAs and the commercialization of Navy Medicine inventions through patent licensing agreements, the NMRC enterprise excels at technology transfer. This is a key part of what the Presidential Memorandum was all about.</Paragraph><Image image_id="16" page_num="11.0"><Alt_Text>A scientific diagram illustrating a cellular interaction between a CD8+ T cell and a liver cell.

The once Notre Dame student had not been back to campus in "too many years to count," according to Villasante. She studied in the laboratory of parasitologist Paul Weinstein, Ph.D., earning her Doctor of Philosophy degree in biology from the University of Notre Dame in 1982. A native of Long Island, New York, Villasante earned her Bachelor of Science degree from the State University of New York at Albany in 1978. Upon receiving her Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame, she began a quest to see the world while doing research. She never imagined one day she would conduct laboratory and field-based research on malaria, leishmaniasis and filariasis in places like Indonesia, Peru, and Egypt. This international career was in parallel to her distinguished rise in the ranks of the Navy, holding a variety of leadership positions over the years. Villasante went to the National Research Council as a postdoctoral fellow in the Leishmaniasis Laboratory as part of the Division of Experimental Therapeutics at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. She discovered the U.S. Navy, where they advertised, "It's not just a Job, it's an Adventure." She was at Walter Reed for two years prior to being commissioned as an officer in the United States Navy in 1984. Not knowing that adventure would be the career of a lifetime, she signed up and has traveled to the deepest pockets of the world re-searching infectious diseases. Over her career, Villasante has held several leadership positions in</Paragraph><Image image_id="20" page_num="13.0"><Alt_Text>A natural photograph depicts four adults standing side-by-side outdoors on a paved path, with a grassy area covered in fallen autumn leaves and trees with yellow and orange foliage in the background.

The Navy Malaria Department concentrates on developing a vaccine for the malaria parasite. She is often asked why would the Navy or any of the armed forces be interested in infectious disease? Her answer is easy: protection for the troops. For example, in 2011 there were 124 cases of malaria, mostly in Afghanistan. Infectious diseases have a direct impact on our military and their ability to carry out their mission. Currently, 51 microbiologists are serving the Navy in active duty around the world, including five research laboratories (Cairo; Lima, Peru; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Silver Spring, Md.; and San Diego). The overseas labs also have areas of concentration specific to the infectious disease found in that area and function in coordination with the local Ministries of Health, academies, and sometimes, active non-governmental organizations. Villasante has been an integral part of the success of the Navy's Medical Service Corps and long history of success in infectious disease research. Their new slogan is a testament to her life's mission: "America's Navy: A Global Force for Good." Therefore, delivering a lecture on Navy careers to young scientists in the same auditorium where she attended lectures as a student was more than a coming home, it was a completion of her educational circle. Life is cyclical.</Paragraph><Paragraph page_num="13.0">13</Paragraph></Section><Section section_id="2.1.4" start_page_num="14.0" end_page_num="14.0"><Heading>NMRC Hosts Visit from the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator</Heading><Paragraph page_num="14.0">(Continued from page 1) vaccine clinical trials.

During their lectures, the officers asked students to generate hypotheses as to how matter changes phases. Using dry ice and some basic laboratory equipment, students were able to observe the general effect of temperature on matter, understand the transition of liquid to gas (vaporization) and understand the direct transition of solid to gas (sublimation). "We were able to leverage resources that are absent in the local public school system to deliver an inquiry-based presentation of phys- ics concepts," said Bishop.

Here in the Washington, D.C. area, the weather has turned noticeably colder. The colder weather, combined with the crowded shopping malls, is a clear sign that the holiday season is upon us. As promised, because we are in the midst of the holiday season, this month I'm presenting additional holiday budgeting tips. Not to be a Scrooge, but many people blow their holiday budgets because they get carried away by the excitement of the season. It's important to remember that you can still have a joyous holiday season without busting your budget. Here are some more ways to save money during the holidays. Set expectations with friends and family. If you're worried about your finances, talk about it with friends and family. They might be just as relieved as you are to set limits on spending or, in some cases, to skip gift-giving entirely. Look for ways to cut back on the number of gifts you buy. If you have a large family or group of friends, ask if they'd like to draw names out of a hat and give one gift per person. Or give family gifts, such as a movies-by-mail membership or a pass to a local museum rather than individual gifts. Look for bargains and remember to use your Exchange! In addition to the usual tax savings and price-matching benefit, you'll find special holiday discounts. If you live in the D.C. area and haven't done so already, check out the nice new NEX in Bethesda! Investigate your travel options. How will you get there? Do you drive instead of fly? Where will you stay, with a friend or relative instead of in a hotel room? Make do without a rental car? Plan in advance. If you didn't manage to book your airline tickets well in advance, looking for last-minute deals and being flexible about your travel dates can also save money. Maybe even consider flying immediately after the holidays rather than before. Use your credit card wisely. Finally, think before you use your credit card to pay for holiday expenses. Don't use it unless you know you can pay it off right away. Don't start your New Year with huge credit card bills! Beyond holiday budgeting, I would like to take brief moment to bring to your attention a couple of other items. First, the nomination period for Operation Homefront's Military Child of the Year Award is open until December 15. The award recognizes outstanding military children who demonstrate resiliency, leadership and achievement. One winner from each branch of service will receive $5,000, a laptop and a trip to D.C. for an awards gala. To submit an application, visit www.militarychildoftheyear.org. Also, Wings Over America Scholarship Foundation (WOASF) is now accepting pre-qualification forms for its scholarships. WOASF annually offers more than forty undergraduate scholarships ranging from \(2000 to \)10,000 to dependent children and spouses of U.S. Navy personnel having served in Naval Aviation commands (Carriers, Wings, Squadrons): officer and enlisted, active duty, retired, honorably discharged or deceased. For more information on eligibility and the application process, please visit www.wingsoveramerica.us. In closing, I'd like to wish everyone a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year. I look forward to working with you in 2013! As always, if you are in search of other resources or assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me.
