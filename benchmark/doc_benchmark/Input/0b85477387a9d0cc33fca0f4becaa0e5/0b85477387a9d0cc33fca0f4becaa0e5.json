Between them and slightly in the foreground is a black microscope on a white lab bench, with a blue office chair positioned behind it. Behind the woman is a large, white NuAire Biological Safety Cabinet, labeled \"CLASS II TYPE A/B3,\" featuring a digital display showing \"11:28,\" several control buttons, and a gauge. Inside the cabinet’s glass-fronted workspace, multiple pipettes are mounted on a yellow rack, alongside various lab containers and an orange biohazard waste bin. To the right of the cabinet, on the wall, are two sheets of paper with printed text. A small white centrifuge sits on a counter to the right, near a window revealing an out-of-focus outdoor scene with bare trees. On a small metal cart next to the chair are a spray bottle, a box of gloves, scissors, and other small lab items. A red sign mounted on the wall above the safety cabinet reads, \"DO NOT USE TOXIC EXPLOSIVE OR FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES IN THIS CABINET.\" The lighting is even and artificial, typical of an institutional interior.
